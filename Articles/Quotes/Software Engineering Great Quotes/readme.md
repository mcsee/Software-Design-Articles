_Phil Wadler_

* * *

> Software is like entropy: It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases.

_Norman Augustine_

* * *

> The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases.

_Jon Bentley and Douglas McIlroy_

_Henry Spencer_

[Code Smell 62 - Flag Variables](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-62-flag-variables)

* * * 

> When your code depends on an interface, that dependency is usually very minor and unobtrusive. Your code doesn’t have to change unless the interface changes, and interfaces typically change far less often than the code behind them. When you have an interface, you can edit classes that implement that interface or add new classes that implement the interface, all without impacting code that uses the interface.

> For this reason, it is better to depend on interfaces or abstract classes than it is to depend on concrete classes. When you depend on less volatile things, you minimize the chance that particular changes will trigger massive recompilation.

_Michael Feathers_

_Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder_

* * *

> The whole point of getting things done is knowing what to leave undone.

_Oswald Chambers_

* * *

> Object-oriented programming increases the value of these metrics by managing this complexity. The most effective tool available for dealing with complexity is abstraction. Many types of abstraction can be used, but encapsulation is the main form of abstraction by which complexity is managed in object-oriented programming.

_Rebecca Wirfs-Brock_

* * * 

> Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.

_Alan Kay_

_Edsger Dijkstra_

* * *

> No amount of elegant programming or technology will solve a problem if it is improperly specified or understood to begin with.

_Milt Bryce_

_Albert Szent-Gyorgi_

* * *

> The longer it takes for a bug to surface, the harder it is to find.

_Roedy Green_

* * *

It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.

_Nathaniel Borenstein_

* * *

> So why was it so hard to tell a computer to do something only mildly complex? Well, it wasn't the "mildly complex" part that was giving me problems; it was the "tell a computer" part.

_Chris Pine_

* * * 

> There is no code so big, twisted, or complex that maintenance can't make it worse.

_Andrew Hunt_

* * *

> Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.

_Edward V Berard_

_Bjarne Stroustrup_

* * *

> Optimization hinders evolution. Everything should be built top-down, except the first time. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

_Alan Perlis_

> A programming language is a system of notation for describing computations. A useful programming language must therefore be suited for both description (i.e., for human writers and readers of programs) and for computation (i.e., for efficient implementation on computers).

> For us, the real goal is to make it so that the software ecosystem is as healthy as possible.

_James Gosling_

> One of the things I've been trying to do is look for simpler or rules underpinning good or bad design. I think one of the most valuable rules is avoiding duplication. "Once and only once" is the Extreme Programming phrase.

_Martin Fowler_

* * *

> Subclasses shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their parent class but will do so with inheritance. This can make a program’s design less flexible. It also introduces the possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don’t make sense or that cause errors because the methods don’t apply to the subclass.

# Software Quality

> Legacy code is code without tests.

_Michael Feathers_

[How to Decouple a Legacy System](https://maximilianocontieri.com/how-to-decouple-a-legacy-system) 

* * *

> Regardless of your plans, production is the ultimate testing environment. 

_J T Wall_

* * *

> Somebody will say they have a program that’s verified and it’s only verified because it met its specification according to some verifier.  But the verifier might have bugs in it. The specifications might have bugs in them

_Donald Knuth_

* * *

> The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time

_Tom Cargill_

* * *

> One man's crappy software is another man's full time job.     

_Jessica Gaston_

[Code Smell 42 - Warnings/Strict Mode Off](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-42-warningsstrict-mode-off)

* * *

> We're entering a new world in which data may be more important than software.

_Tim O'Reilly_

* * *

> The pesticide paradox. Every method you use to prevent or find bugs leaves a residue of subtler bugs against which those methods are ineffective.

_Boris Beizer_

[Code Smell 30 - Mocking Business](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-30-mocking-business)

* * *

I try to think mostly in terms of preconditions, and checking things in the constructor and the beginning of a function.

_Brad Fitzpatrick_

* * *

> "Don't fix it if it ain't broke" presupposed that you can't improve something that works reasonably well already. If the world's inventors had believed this, we'd still be driving Model A Fords and using outhouses.

_H. W. Kenton_

* * *

> The first step of any project is to grossly underestimate its complexity and difficulty.

_Nicoll Hunt_

* * *

> Good software, like wine, takes time.

_Joel Spolsky_

* * *

> Pasting code from the internet into production code is like chewing gum found in the street.

_Mike Johnson_

* * *

> Discovering the unexpected is more important than confirming the known.

_George E. P. Box_

* * *

> Pay attention to zeros. If there is a zero, someone will divide by it.

_Cem Kaner_

* * *

> Beta testing is a symptom of weak testing practices and poor communication with customers

_Kent Beck_

* * *

> Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it. 

_Donald Knuth_

[Stop Calling them ‘Bugs’](https://maximilianocontieri.com/stop-calling-them-bugs)

* * *

> The key to building a great product is building a great team first. To me, great teams aren’t bound by roles, but they’re driven by moving forward.

_Alan Page_

* * * 

> Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance.

_Jon Franklin_

* * *

> With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably.
> Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.”

_Michael Feathers_

[How to Squeeze Test Driven Development on Legacy Systems](https://maximilianocontieri.com/how-to-squeeze-test-driven-development-on-legacy-systems)

* * *

> Don't patch bad code - rewrite it.

_P. J. Plauger_

* * *

> Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.

_Bertrand Meyer_

[Code Smell 86 - Mutable Const Arrays](Code Smells\Code Smell 86 - Mutable Const Arrays)

* * *

> A Perl program is correct if it gets the job done before your boss fires you.

_Larry Wall_

[Code Smell 41 - Regular Expression Abusers](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-41-regular-expression-abusers)

* * *

> As the Tests get more Specific, the Code gets more Generic.

_Robert Martin_

* * *

> Software testing is not only ensuring absence of bugs but also ensuring presence of value.

_Amit Kalantri_

* * *

> When you choose a language, you're choosing more than a set of technical trade-offs-you're choosing a community.

_Joshua Bloch_

* * *

> Quality is free, but only to those who are willing to pay heavily for it.

_DeMarco and Lister_

* * *

> Developer testing is an important step towards accountability. It gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software they produce.

_Kent Beck_

* * *

> It’s hard enough to find an error in your code when you’re looking for it; its even harder when you’ve assumed your code is error-free.

_Steve McConnell_

* * *

> On the seventh day, God said, "Ship it! We'll release patches later."

_Josh Flachsbart_

* * * 

> Make it hard to ignore error conditions. Don't bury error codes in return values.

_Steve Maguire_

* * * 

> One of the most valuable things about TDD is that it lets us concentrate on one thing at a time. We are either writing code or refactoring; we are never doing both at once.

_Michael Feathers_

* * * 

> You haven't mastered a tool until you understand when it should not be used.

_Kelsey Hightower_

* * *

> Reducing a product's definition to a list of features and functions ignores the real opportunity - orchestrating technological capability to serve human needs and goals.

_Alan Cooper_

* * *

> Beyond basic mathematical aptitude, the difference between good programmers and great programmers is verbal ability.

_Marissa Mayer_

[Code Smell 90 - Implementative Callback Events](Code Smells\Code Smell 90 - Implementative Callback Events)

* * * 

> We argue that design practices which take a data-driven approach fail to maximize encapsulation because they focus too quickly on the implementation of objects. We propose an alternative object-oriented design method which takes a responsibility-driven approach.

_Rebecca Wirf Brooks_

[Code Smell 63 - Feature Envy](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-63-feature-envy)

* * *

> .. one of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that, lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs.

_Robert Firth_

* * *

> Software never was perfect and won’t get perfect. But is that a license to create garbage? The missing ingredient is our reluctance to quantify quality.

_Boris Beizer_

* * *

> Nothing makes a system more flexible than a suite of tests.

_Robert Martin_

[Code Smell 82 - Tests Violating Encapsulation](Code Smells\Code Smell 82 - Tests Violating Encapsulation)

* * *

> Programming is similar to a game of golf. The point is not getting the ball in the hole but how many strokes it takes.

_Harlan D. Mills_

* * *

> If you’re afraid to change something it is clearly poorly designed.

_Martin Fowler_

* * *

> As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications.

_David Parnas_

* * *

> There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.

_Alan J. Perlis_

# Refactoring

> Whenever I have to think to understand what the code is doing, I ask myself if I can refactor the code to make that understanding more immediately apparent.

_Martin Fowler_

[Code Smell 67 - Middle Man](https://maximilianocontieri.com/code-smell-67-middle-man)

* * *

> A true professional does not waste the time and money of other people by handing over software that is not reasonably free of obvious bugs; that has not undergone minimal unit testing; that does not meet the specifications and requirements; that is gold-plated with unnecessary features; or that looks like junk.

_Daniel Read_

* * *

> Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.

# Object Oriented

> Let there be no doubt that object-oriented design is fundamentally different than traditional structured design approaches: it requires different ways of thinking about decomposition, and it produces software architectures that are largely outside the realm of the structured design culture.

_Grady Booch_

* * *

> I invented the term ‘object oriented’, and C++ was not what I had in mind.

_Alan Kay_
