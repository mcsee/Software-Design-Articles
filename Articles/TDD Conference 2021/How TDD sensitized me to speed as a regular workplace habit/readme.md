*How TDD sensitized me to speed as a regular workplace habit - Ragunath Jawahar*

> TL;DR: Short feedback loops should fail fast, grab attention and suggest corrective actions
 
First International Test Driven Development took place on July 10th. 

In this series, I will include every talk together with my notes and further reading.

Hopefully, a lot of readers will watch and rewatch the talks, as they are worth several reviews.

Let's continue...

## Bio 

Ragunath has consulted organizations like Gojek, Dunzo, Tiffany & Co., Mizuno, etc., for a decade. He stabilizes fast-growing teams and reclaims codebases that teams are afraid to change. He is a fan of fast feedback cycles and also believes that you are only as good as the team you build.

# My Personal notes

- On a good feedback loop, the system tells you when something is not right.
- They help us catch mistakes early on.
- Good feedback loops are not as good as feedback loops telling you something is wrong.
- Negative Feedback loops help experiment much faster and figure out small solutions
- IDEs shorten feedback loops
- We must shorten the latency between the action and the consequence
- IDEs with excellent feedback guide through available options
- We classify stimulus under (Latency, Attention and Response)
- Grammar.ly works in the same way, shortening feedback loops
- UIs are very difficult to unit test
- Excellent feedback loops should fail fast, grab attention and suggest a corrective action
- improve feedback cycles measuring cost-benefits

> The only way to go fast is to go well
