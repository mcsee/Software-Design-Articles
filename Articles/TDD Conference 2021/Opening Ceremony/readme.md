First International Test Driven Development took place on July 30th. 

In this series, I will include every talk together with my notes and further reading.

Hopefully, a lot of readers will watch and rewatch the talks, as they are worth several reviews.

Let's start...

# My Personal notes

- This is the first conference and the passing torch to younger generations of TDD enthusiasts.
- We discovered TDD several years ago thanks to Kent Beck.
- We evolved with James Grenning's [Zombies Formula](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/TDD/How%20I%20Survived%20the%20Zombie%20Apocalypse/readme.md).
- Ron Jeffries' Never let the code not be working.
- And so on...

## Why TDD?

- TDD is not as easy to sell as clean code, agility, secure architectures.
- We will consider it, but there's no time now.

## TDD as a scientific method

- Based on positive enforcement and short feedback loops.
- Watching nature phenomena.
- Everything happens as a response to what happened earlier.

## The Four current problems when we try to plan

- Uncertainty
- Ambiguity
- Incompleteness
- Confusion

## TDD Breakthroughs

- TDD Removes non-productive code.
- Less Debugger time.
- No more manually run the app.
- No different manual test scenarios, credentials, navigation, configuration, environments, etc.
