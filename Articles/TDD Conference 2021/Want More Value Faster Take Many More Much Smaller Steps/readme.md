First International Test Driven Development took place on July 30th. 

In this series, I will include every talk together with my notes and further reading.

Hopefully, a lot of readers will watch and rewatch the talks, as they are worth several reviews.

Let's continue...

# Want More Value Faster? Take Many More Much Smaller Steps - GeePaw Hill

## Bio 

We all know and love GeePaw and his inimitable style of "Helping Geeks Produce for Over 40 Years."

> TL;DR: Baby steps are the best way to go from one place to the next one.

# My Personal notes

- TDD is like cooking. We use too much rice and too little garlic.
- Take many more (and) smaller steps to change faster.
- Old demonstrations are ridiculous tiny compared with today's.
-- Single threaded construction
-- Target didn't change.
- Today, we work on gigantic apps with changing requirements.
- We should divide and conquer (decompose) more.
- Take baby steps between activated states.
-- We should fix maximum duration to keep steps "baby" (< 1 hour).
-- The most efficient path is the one with smaller steps.
--- Even if some steps don't produce user value or diverge.
---- They just can't get worse.
- The [Walking Skeleton](https://wiki.c2.com/?WalkingSkeleton) is the working app.
- Software isn't plain geometry.
- Changeability costs less than rework avoidance.
- We seldom can go from one point to other in a straight line.
- Problems in software are not polynomial. They get NP Hard.
- During baby steps, we should not be interrupted. (or we will need to start over)
- Programming is thinking. It is not related to typing.
- on TDD we have automated consequence detection, fast context switching and executable documentation.
- *The worse bugs in the world are the ones you had no idea you just shipped.*
- We should maximize knowledge sharing to increase changeability.
- The only requirement is for steps to be as small as possible.
- TDD is not as simple as Red, Green, Refactor. It takes time to master.
- We need to collaborate by mobbing, pairing and swarming.
-- They are not natural skills.

> We live in a world of misconceptions of thinking knowing syntax is at the heart of the problems. Lot of people believe there's a technical solution to every problem and that it would be best for all us to sit in dark rooms working quietly by ourselves.
