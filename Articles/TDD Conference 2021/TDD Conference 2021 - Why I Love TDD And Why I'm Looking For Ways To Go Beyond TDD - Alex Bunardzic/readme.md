# My Personal notes

- We spend half our time playing the guitar and the other half tuning it
- The longer we wait before we make a change and see its impact, the more we dive in the dark
- We need to shorten the feedback loop
- We should deploy every keystroke to production like collaborating on Google Docs
- Creating from scratch a [TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) system with an automated script going to commit or revert according to test results.
- We go from a steady state to another steady state
- We are driven by symmetry
- As always, we start faking it until we start making it
- Prime directive is for system to be always up and running
- Once we write many tests, we can run mutation testing
- Accidental complexly is the pain on our systems
