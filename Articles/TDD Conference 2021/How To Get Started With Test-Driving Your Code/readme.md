First International Test Driven Development took place on July 10th. 

In this series, I will include every talk together with my notes and further reading.

Hopefully, a lot of readers will watch and rewatch the talks, as they are worth several reviews.

Let's continue...

# My Personal notes

- TDD is not a testing strategy or tool.
- TDD is a skill
- It takes a lot of time to master TDD.
- Customers don't care if we write tests, but they do care about the quality.
- Today there are at least two TDD Styles: [London School and Chicago School](https://cleancoders.com/episode/comparativeDesign-episode-1)
- Chicago School is inside-out. It designs on the green.
- London School is outside-in and [abuses mocks](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2030%20-%20Mocking%20Business/readme.md). It designs on the red stage.
- When we plan the tests, we can use [ZOMBIES](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/TDD/How%20I%20Survived%20the%20Zombie%20Apocalypse/readme.md) guidance.
- We must ensure tests are failing for the right reason. It is not enough to watch them fail.
- In TDD, procrastination is a good thing. The more we delay a decision, the better our solutions are.
