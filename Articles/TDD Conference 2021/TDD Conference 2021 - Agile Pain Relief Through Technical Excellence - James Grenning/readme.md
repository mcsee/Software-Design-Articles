First International Test Driven Development took place on July 30th. 

In this series, I will include every talk together with my notes and further reading.

Hopefully, a lot of readers will watch and rewatch the talks, as they are worth several reviews.

Let's continue...

## Bio 

One of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto, James Grenning trains, coaches and consults worldwide. With decades of software development experience, both technical and managerial, James brings a wealth of knowledge, skill, and creativity to software development teams and their management. As his professional roots are in embedded software, he is leading the way to introduce Agile development practices to that challenging world.

> TL;DR: We should aim for technical excellence.

# My Personal notes 

- The industry suffered from defects, delays, and frustration.
- [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) was made by technical people who focused on people
- Scrum is about exposing inadequacies and make them transparent, so the organization can see them and fix them.
-- Unfortunately, many organizations adapt their bad models to look like scrum.
- [Deming Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) is pretty similar to TDD.
- Scrum is followed by dogma followers.
- You can learn in a steady pace, but if you have bad fundamentals you will encounter a plateau.
- If you iterate and save your test at the end, you end up getting flooded by pressure.
- We need to aim for technical excellence.
-- Hacking new features, and managing bugs is not excellence.
- incremental management needs incremental engineering.
- There are 6 scrum masters for every 1 scrum developer.
- Sprint is a bad world because it consumes athletes.
- Iterative planning is easy, technical excellence, and respecting people are hard.
- Fast feedback is about staying focused.
- A bug is not a bug until the root cause is found.
- When you fix a bug, other bugs come to the funeral.
- We make mistakes, with TDD, mistakes jump in our faces.
- Getting regular rewards is much better than getting a big reward at the end.
- We can program for several years without improving.
- We can do TDD even on embedded systems. So "we are special" is not an excuse.
-- Everyone thinks is special.
- The first step to recovery. Say it loud:

> I am a programmer and I write [bugs](Theory\Stop Calling them 'Bugs').
