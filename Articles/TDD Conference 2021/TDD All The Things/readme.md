# My Personal notes

- BDD suggests we should start methods with 'should' instead of 'test'.
- Nowadays we have annotations on tests.
- BDD forces us to think about behavior.
- TDD cycle as behavior: Test = Describe behavior, Pass = Change behavior, Refactor = Amplify the positives
- The sandwich methodology: Say something good, then something bad, and after that something good again.
- The sandwich done well: describe what you want and don't let people write their own code.
- Try to find psychological safety. 
- Novice people can write tests by copying existing ones. 
- Experienced Beginners can get TDD working from scratch.
- Practitioners write tests before the code.
- Knowledgeable Practitioners teach TDD to others.
- When refactoring, aim for better, not perfect.
- When refactoring people, we should play to our strengths and be forgiving.
- In complexity, tests and descriptions of behavior are just examples of what might happen.
