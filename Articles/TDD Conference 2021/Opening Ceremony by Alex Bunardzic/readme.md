Let's start...

# My Personal notes

- This is the first conference and the passing torch to younger generations of TDD enthusiasts.
- We discovered TDD several years ago thanks to Kent Beck.
- We evolved with James Grenning's [Zombies Formula](TDD\How I Survived the Zombie Apocalypse).
- Ron Jeffries' Never let the code not be working.
- And so on...

## Why TDD?

- TDD is not as easy to sell as clean code, agility, secure architectures.
- We will consider it, but there's no time now.

## TDD as a scientific method

- Based on positive enforcement and short feedback loops.
- Watching nature phenomena.
- Everything happens as a response to what happened earlier.

## The Four current problems when we try to plan

- Uncertainty
- Ambiguity
- Incompleteness
- Confusion

## TDD Breakthroughs

- TDD Removes non-productive code.
- Less Debugger time.
- No more manually run the app.
- No different manual test scenarios, credentials, navigation, configuration, environments, etc.
