First International Test Driven Development took place on July 10th. 

In this series, I will include every talk together with my notes and further reading.

Hopefully, a lot of readers will watch and rewatch the talks, as they are worth several reviews.

Let's continue...

# My Personal notes

- Daniel presented [TDD Manifesto](https://tddmanifesto.com/)
- The TDD manifesto celebrates 20 years of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).
- There are lots of misunderstandings about TDD.
- Manifesto has several sections:
-- Values of TDD
-- [What is not TDD](https://tddmanifesto.com/what-is-not-tdd/)
-- [Getting Started](https://tddmanifesto.com/getting-started/)
-- [A clean test](https://tddmanifesto.com/a-clean-test/)
-- [Exercises](https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/)
-- [About us](https://tddmanifesto.com/about-us/)

> If we want to trust our code, we need to trust our tests.
