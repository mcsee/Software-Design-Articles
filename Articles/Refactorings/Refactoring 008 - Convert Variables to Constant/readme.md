![Refactoring 008 - Convert Variables to Constant](Refactoring%20008%20-%20Convert%20Variables%20to%20Constant.jpg)

*If I see a Variable that does not change. I call that variable a constant*

> TL;DR: Be explicit on what mutates and what does not.

# Problems Addressed

- [Mutability](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20Evil%20Power%20of%20Mutants/readme.md)

- Code Optimization

# Steps

1. Find the scope of the variable

2. Define a constant with the same scope

3. Replace the variable 

# Sample Code

## Before

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/3ae265e1ae7422164c175b16a7f822d3) -->

```javascript
let lightSpeed = 300000;
var gravity = 9.8;

// 1. Find the scope of the variable
// 2. Define a constant with the same scope
// 3. Replace the variable
```

## After

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/e25d1ded85b4547d20fee70e4c1f0ca6) -->

```javascript
const lightSpeed = 300000;
const gravity = 9.8;

// 1. Find the scope of the variable
// 2. Define a constant with the same scope
// 3. Replace the variable 

// If the object is compound, 
// we might need Object.freeze(gravity);
```

# Type

[X] Automatic

Our IDEs can check if a variable is written but never updated.

# Safety

This is a safe refactor.

# Why is the Code Better?

Code is more compact and declarative.

We can make and step further and use operators like *var*, *let*, *const*, etc.

The scope is more clear.
