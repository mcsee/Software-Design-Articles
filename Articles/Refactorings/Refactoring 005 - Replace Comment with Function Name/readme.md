# Type 📝

[X] Semi-Automatic

Some IDEs have this refactoring although naming is not fully automatic.

# Safety 🛡️

This is a safe refactoring.

# Why is the Code Better? ✨

Comments always lie.

It is hard to maintain comments.

On the contrary, Functions are alive and self-explanatory.

# Limitations ⚠️

As always, very important design decisions are valid comments.

# Tags 🏷️
