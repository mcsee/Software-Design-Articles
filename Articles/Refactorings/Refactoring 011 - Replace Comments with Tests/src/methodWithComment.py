def multiply(a, b):
    # This function multiplies two numbers and returns the result
    # If one of the numbers is zero, the result will be zero
    # If the number are both positive, the result will be positive
    # If the number are both negative, the result will be positive
    # The multiplication is done by invoking a primitive

# This code has a comment that explains what the function does.
# Instead of relying on this comment to understand the behavior of the code,
# You can write some unit tests that verify the behavior of the function.
