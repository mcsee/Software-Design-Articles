![50 Fundamental Advices for Junior Developers](50%20Fundamental%20Advices%20for%20Junior%20Developers.gif)

*What I would say to myself if I could travel to my past.*

> TL;DR: Advices for myself

Today I wrote a tweet asking for recommendations for junior developers

[Twitter](https://x.com/1359541631171653640)

I got a lot of very interesting answers. I will group them down here.

Tweets are textual, I chose the more representative, corrected some typos and abbreviations and added some references.

## I Agree with

Iâ€™m not a Jr Dev, yet. But if I had the experience, my advice to a Jr. Dev and to my future self is; be a student for the rest of your career. Listen to every dev no matter the age and experience. Stay humble, that will make people relied on you and reliable means stable job.

* * *

1. Learn your tools deeply. 
2. Delete everything and start again after you've gone through the tutorials. If you can't, you won't trust yourself when things stop working (eventually they will). 
3. Learn TDD; it makes for better code. Senior devs will want to help you more.

Learn to listen and watch what the others do. Then combine what you learned into your own personal framework. ðŸ˜Š

@[Oliver Jumpertz](@OliverJumpertz)

* * *

Try to find a solution by your own first before asking a question.

https://x.com/muh_rahmatullah

* * *

Take the code as waste. Don't get sentimental about it, and always strive to trash it away.

@[Jovche Mitrejchevski](@jovchem)

* * *

If you focus on solving customer requests and business problems, the frameworks and patterns can help you. If you focus on using frameworks and patterns, they will actually get in the way of solving business problems.

https://x.com/ninjasavant

* * *

Know your stack, sure, but it's equally important to develop your habits and approach.

https://x.com/tottinge

* * *

Be confident. Your first thought about a project should be, "We can do this." NOT "Maybe we can 'lift it and shift it' to the cloud?"

https://x.com/Write_again

* * * 

Do not follow twitter roadmaps or "how to become a xxx developer". Often, they are misleading, extremely simplified and wrong.

https://x.com/IvanVHIS

* * *

keep your head cold when debugging ..and know that every error you'll face is caused by some kind of typo or wrong reference path ..remember to take a day off every week

Be persistent. Always take some walk when you feel exhausted.

https://x.com/BEARD__ED

* * *

Persistence trumps all.
I would add to that, in order to have persistence you have to enjoy the process.  You have to love that feeling of satisfaction you get from solving a difficult problem, or when you get your "aha!" moments.

Consistency applied over time wins...consistently coding (even if just a short amount) over time will build the experience you need. Bonus if you keep up on the latest trends in languages.

https://x.com/Luke4OSS

* * *

Stop labeling yourself

https://x.com/mohsen_esm

* * *

You need to be motivated and have a drive! The BEST dev's I have had the pleasure of working with are constantly learning new ideas and technologies. They are builders. They enjoy building new things. They do these things bc they love it! Not bc their job asked them to do it.

1. Do framework intro tutorials for all new frameworks. You learn a ton. Don't just 'make it work'.
2. If using Pluralsight, do it with the class.
3. Read co-workers check-ins. Look at how/why they did stuff.
4. Know the business that you code for well.
5. Don't ignore devops.
6. Look at major code files in your app and read their histories.

read some of the classics, but beware: nobody has found the holy grail of software development. Classics? The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete, Refactoring, Clean Code, Design Patterns to name only few, peek into the domain you write SW for, try to get an understanding of it.

https://x.com/dueppecn

* * *

1. On any project, dont underestimate whatever has to be done before the actual coding. 

2. Don't forget, code is a tool,not the solution. Code is only necessary, as a hammer to a nail. Find projects, challenges that demand your code. Find your nails.

[How I Survived the Zombie Apocalypse](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/TDD/How%20I%20Survived%20the%20Zombie%20Apocalypse/readme.md)

* * *

1- don't do it alone if you can help it! Review your peers' code, read through open source code and really strive to understand it, pair program if you can. Being a professional dev is a social endeavor and you should learn that early

2- learning your first language will be hard. Learning your second is likely to be harder. From #3 onwards you stop caring too much about nitty gritty details and think about the structure of your code

3- get something to production. Do it at your pace, but do it. Learn to build a pipeline, deploy, log, and get to the point where you can claim that people - even if just a half dozen - can access some value from your code anytime anywhere

https://x.com/GaurangDhorda

* * *

code in the langage that you love, not in the languages that are available in the business markets. And never stop learning.

https://x.com/MehdiZahrane

* * *

Find out quickly what learning strategy fits you best. Find mentors. Have faith in Google and Stack Overflow. Grit and technical communication are more important than your algorithmic know-how.

https://x.com/O_Magger

* * *

Aim to write good, well tested code. Not perfect code. Build relationships and never throw them away. Failure is a valuable resource, but not if you don't listen or learn from it. Be passionate about your work but don't try to make it your life.

Explore, explore, explore. Do not just follow the trends, find what you like and stick to it. You don't need to know everything, expanding on what you enjoy doing is the key.

https://x.com/codename_arl

* * *

I always tell my juniors to learn the basics of whatever language they are doing. For e.g learn basics of javascript before moving to framework like Angular, React or VueJs. Learn basics of PHP before working on laravel or code ignitor etc.

https://x.com/AmanpreetDev

* * *

Donâ€™t be afraid to challenge the status quo and never stop learning!

https://x.com/nileshdk

* * *

Never stop learning. Even those of us who have been doing this for over a decade are still learning new things.

Don't kill your personal life to do so, of course, but set aside at least a little bit of time to learn new things. Or deeper into what you're doing now. Either way.

It's okay to ask questions. 

Always give it your best shot, but don't be afraid to ask if you get stuck or need clarification.

Don't think of frameworks and libraries like some magic black box of voodoo mumbo jumbo. I notice a lot of beginners don't seem to realiize that we all use the same tools to build the same stuff, even Google, Microsoft and whatnot. They all put their pants on one leg at a time.

# Conclusion

As you can see, many of the advices are related to soft skills and developing fundamentals. This is not correlated to what junior developers do, focus on trendy tools and languages. 

> We, as more senior and experienced people, must guide and mentor them to avoid the mistakes we made and to escape from the misleading calls from the industry.
