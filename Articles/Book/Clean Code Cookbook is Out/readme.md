*It is finally here!!!*

> TL;DR: Go get the book!

I began crafting the initial draft of *Clean Code Cookbook* during the COVID-19 lockdown.

A couple of years later, Melissa Duffield and Louise Corrigan contacted me and encouraged to write a book about clean code.

The journey was incredibly smooth, thanks to the invaluable assistance of Sara Hunter and the entire O'Reilly team.

Now, I am happy to have it on my shelf and share it with you.
You can find it at the following links:

The book covers many software desing recipes useful for small and large scale systems.

The target audience is any programmer willing to write clean, robust and mainatainable code.

Let me know what you think.
