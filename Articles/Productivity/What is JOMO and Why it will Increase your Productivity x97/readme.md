- Modern sites and applications exploit our primitive vulnerabilities. Our brains are wired for alerts and attention. This is how we survive as a race.

- We are safer than ever now. We don't need to be so alert nowadays. Even on COVID-19 times.

According to Patrick McGinnis' 3 tips, we can fight it:

- FOMO is based on the perception that something out there is better than what we are doing now. But sometimes perception is a deception in disguise.

- Limit your time online to a fixed amount.

- We can control FOMO using full consciousness, mindfulness, or meditation.
