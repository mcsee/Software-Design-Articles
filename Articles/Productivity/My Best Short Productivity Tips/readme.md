# 1- Lazy people automate 🤖

Try to avoid repetitive tasks. 

Use scripts, programming, RPA, or anything suitable for you. 

But **never** automate until you master the tasks. 

This is procrastination monkey disguised! 🙈

# 2- Schedule time on own calendar after setting goals 📆

Put auto meetings to timebox your tasks.

This is especially important if your calendar is public and other people can book you meetings.

# 3- Schedule 50 minutes or 25 minutes meetings ⏱️

This way you can rest between meetings.

# 4- Don't be a slave to your calendar 📅☝️

Plan but don't over plan or micromanage yourself.

The calendar is at your service. Not the way around.

# 5- Keep the information in a central place📑

Don't have multiple ToDos, lists, Trellos, [Kanbans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban), bookmarks.

Use a single one. The way [Marie Kondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo) manages her mess. 

# 6- Sprint and pause like cycling 🚴

Sometimes you need to run a marathon, and the other time you will need to rush. Toggle tasks.

# 7- When browsing open a new window🌐

If you need to start a new subject (or procrastinate), do it on a new browser page, never a tab.

This way if you open multiple tabs they will be related, and you will close all of them together instead of keeping polluting the original window.

Don't use Chrome's [tab grouping](https://blog.google/products/chrome/manage-tabs-with-google-chrome/).

You can even save the whole web page for offline browsing.

# 8- Use Micro-rewards 🏆

When doing [Pomodoro](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) short tasks, you can auto reward the completion with small games (like a Candy Crush level) or a [short film](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7sDT8jZ76VLV1u__krUutA). This will improve your focus coming back.

# 9- Silence the Noise 🔇

Use [hacks](https://ivm.hashnode.dev/twitter-setup) to avoid distractions and noise on social networks.

Use blockers like [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/).

# 10- Mind the Principles ✨

Read about how [your mind](https://www.netflix.com/title/81098586) works. 

Don't buy fancy quick solutions.

The productivity techniques that work are [built on principles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-things-done-lessons-in-productivity/). Not quick hacks. Or fancy tools.

# 11- Repeat until you create a habit. 🔁

It takes about 21 repetition days to [create a hardwired habit](Productivity\10 More Simple Tips to Boost Your Productivity x2 (2021 Guide)). 

Use [Savers Technique](https://lifehacker.com/start-your-day-off-right-with-the-savers-morning-routin-1716241117)

# 12- Don't interrupt your tasks. 🚦

*This advice is repeated in all my articles.*

The flow process is hard to [get back](https://techtreats.pacohq.com/the-high-price-of-context-switching-for-developers-and-ways-to-avoid-it) and multitasking is a big lie.

I'm sure there are plenty of productivity pieces of advice around. Which one does work for you?
