# 17. Track Goal and Metrics 🎯

- Goals and objectives are important. But without tracking they are useless.
- Progress metrics, and goal replanning, are keys.
- It's never all-or-nothing!
- Don't plan and abandon!

# 18. Build Habits 🏃

- It takes at least 21 days for an old mental image to dissolve and a new one to harden.
- Creating (or removing) a habit is straightforward.
- Repeat 21 days (streak).
- Fake it till you make it.

# 19. Focus 👁️
- If the product is free, **you** are the product
- Attention is *your* asset
- When you use a website, application, or software and try to do A, you will see many alerts, banners, messages, and click baits prompting you to do B/C/D, etc.
- Be like Ulysses, don't listen to Mermaids!

# 20. Disable notification questions 🔕

- Notifications are our enemy.
- But notification prompts are also a Foe.
- Disable *Notifications Requests* at all, on mobile or web.

- There's no plan
- Set aims and change direction if necessary

# 22 Summon the [Panic Monster](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator)! 👾

To avoid Procrastination set daily goals with artificial hard deadlines.

*I try to write daily articles even though they are far from perfect. 
Fake deadline: today.*
 
# 23: Avoid Twitter trends 🤐

(web hack)

1. Go to “Explore” under “Home”
2. Click the wheel at the right of the “Search Twitter” box.
3. Click “Explore Locations”.
4. Pick a country (like [St Kitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis)).
5. Now the “What’s Happening” will only display content for the location (empty).
6. You will only see your timeline.

# 25. Auto Deadlines 🔫

- Use *time limits* to your advantage. Even if you don’t have a real deadline for a task, set one for yourself. 
- Knowing that you only have four hours left, will help ensure you don’t waste an hour of it on social media.

# 26. Set [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals 👩🏾‍🔬

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**ttainable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

Write your goals as *SMART* Sentences:

Example:
> “Write one [Code Smell](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Stinky%20parts%20of%20your%20Code/readme.md) article every week until 2032."

# 27. Drastic Measures 🐱‍🚀

- Auto-block some distraction websites.
- Use [BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocksite-stay-focused-co/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh) or similar to keep you off social media or news
- Block site IPs on hosts.txt or similar.
- Cut off the internet using router rules.
- Go to an internet void zone in the wild.
- Engage in a goal-based group to be accountable.

This list is far from finished. But my auto-deadline was today.

Hopefully, draft tips will be out next week!
