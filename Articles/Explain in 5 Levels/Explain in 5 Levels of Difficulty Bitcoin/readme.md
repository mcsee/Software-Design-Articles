*Bitcoin is here to stay*

> TL;DR: I will explain Bitcoin in five levels to different audiences.

# Child

Bitcoin is like coins you can use on the internet.

Imagine having coins in a video game that you can exchange for goods.

You can purchase candies, save them for later, or trade your Bitcoin like fantasy coins.

# Teen

You can use Bitcoin to buy things online or trade with other people.

Itï¿½s different from real bills or physical coins because no bank or government prints or issues it.

The Bitcoin network uses blockchain technology to track transactions and ensure everything is visible and safe.

It functions similarly to a secret code only you and the friend you're sending it to understand.

# College Student

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions. 

It runs on a chain of blocks (the blockchain).

The blockchain acts as a public ledger that keeps track of every transaction and is incredibly transparent.

Bitcoin does not require a central authority, unlike real money issued by a bank or government.

You can buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin on several platforms online and spend it on actual physical shops or online, like a credit card.

This lack of authority makes it resistant to interference, monitoring, or censorship. 

# Graduate Student

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that operates on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network.

This public distributed ledger network secures transparent and immutable transactions without relying on intermediaries or a central authority.

To guarantee the integrity and immutability of the transactions, the design incorporates encryption and a distributed ledger system.

Its decentralized disposition presents financial sovereignty.

This is very attractive as an alternative to traditional banking systems. 

The emergence property of the blockchain adds new interesting properties different from traditional asset management.

Bitcoin's value fluctuates based on market demand, and people often see it as both a digital asset and a potential store of value.

# Expert

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses proof-of-work, a novel consensus method, to protect its network without intermediaries.

The decentralized implementation of Bitcoin with its restricted and predetermined supply have consequential implications for global government, banking, and economics.

Bitcoin brings financial sovereignty, resistance to censorship, and a hedge against traditional financial risks. 

The ledger is based on a public, durable, immutable, and transparent blockchain that records all transactions. 

To add new blocks to the blockchain, miners must solve challenging cryptographic problems.

The miners get a prize reward encouraging them to keep the lights up.

The protocol protects the transaction security and avoids double-spending with the miner's challenge.   

Like real gold, Bitcoin is a unique digital asset due to its deflationary nature and limited supply of fixed 21 million units.

The halving event reduces the reward for mining Bitcoin blocks by half approximately every four years.

This event controls the supply of Bitcoin preventing inflation.

With every halving, the supply decreases. The last Bitcoin will be issued around the year 2140, based on the current rate of block rewards and the scheduled halving events.
