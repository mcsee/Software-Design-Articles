> TL;DR: What is ChatGPT and why you should learn how to use it?

Hello from the Future!

I will explain ChatGPT on Five Levels (a child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert).

I've been writing a lot on Artificial Intelligence and also presented some [Code Assistant tools](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Wordle/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Wordle%20as%20a%20Centaur/readme.md).

The day it became available I was so fascinated I kept talking to it and I wrote [an article](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/ChatGPT%20is%20Amazing.%20And%20It%20is%20FREE/readme.md) late at night.

My 2023 goal will be to write a [coding assistant](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/I%20Want%20to%20Build%20a%20Learning%20Companion%20for%20New%20Developers%20Using%20AI/readme.md) helping to write [amazing software](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Stinky%20parts%20of%20your%20Code/readme.md).

ChatGPT is a game changer. 
It is much better than [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/Why%20GitHub%20Copilot%20is%20not%20a%20Threat%20to%20your%20Job/readme.md) and [Alpha Code](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/DeepMind's%20AlphaCode%20Won't%20Steal%20Your%20Job%20Either/readme.md).

Is not yet another development and I need to explain it to non-technical people.

# Child

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a computer program that can hold conversations with people. 

It uses a technique called "machine learning" to generate responses to things that people say. 

ChatGPT can learn from examples of how people talk, and then use that knowledge to generate its own responses.

When someone says something to ChatGPT, the program looks at the words in the sentence and tries to understand what the person is trying to say. 

It does this by using a big database of words and their meanings, which helps it understand the context of the conversation.

It seem like it's a real person talking to you!

# Teen

ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool developed by OpenAI, a leading research organization in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). 

GTP is a type of language model that uses machine-learning techniques to generate human-like text.

The main purpose of ChatGPT is to enable computers to hold conversations with humans in a way that is natural and intuitive. 

One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to "remember" previous conversations and use this information to generate more appropriate responses. 

Once ChatGPT understands the context of the conversation, it uses a special type of computer program called a "neural network" to generate a response. 

A neural network is a set of algorithms that can learn and make predictions based on data.

The neural network is trained on a large dataset of conversation examples. 

It uses that training to generate responses that are appropriate for the conversation.

You can use ChatGPT as a helper to carry on your homework, help you learn, and even replace Internet search tools.

# College Student

ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool.

It is a variant of the [GPT](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/I've%20Recently%20Learned%20About%20GPT3%20-%20This%20is%20my%20Journey/readme.md) (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model

ChatGPT uses a combination of advanced NLP techniques and a neural network.

A Neural Network is a type of machine learning model that is designed to process and analyze large amounts of data.

ChatGPT is a sophisticated tool that is capable of holding engaging and natural conversations with humans. 

it is a valuable asset in a variety of applications, including customer service, virtual assistants, and chatbots. 

It is currently free since its creators are using our input as reinforcement training data.

This will change soon.

# Graduate Student

ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool. 

The main purpose of ChatGPT is to enable computers to hold conversations with humans in a way that is natural and intuitive. 

it uses a combination of advanced NLP techniques and a neural networks.

One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to "remember" previous conversations and use this information to generate more appropriate responses. 

The technique is called "contextual learning". 

It allows the model to retain information about the conversation and use it to generate more relevant responses.

While ChatGPT is not specifically designed to generate functional code, it could potentially be used to assist with coding tasks in certain ways. 

ChatGPT or similar tools could potentially be used to generate pseudocode or outlines of algorithms, which can be helpful in planning and organizing the structure of a program. 

This could be particularly useful for projects that involve a large amount of code, as it can help to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.

It's important to note, however, that ChatGPT or similar tools should not be relied upon as a replacement for human coding skills. 

While they can be useful for generating text or outlines, they are not capable of generating functional code or solving complex coding problems on their own. 

Recent research shows, automated code generated can be more [Insecure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03622.pdf).

Ultimately, the most effective way to improve coding skills is through practice and hands-on experience.

Since ChatGPT often gives wrong results, you should always check the sources and not trust blindly what it says.

# Expert

ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model.

In terms of implementation, ChatGPT is built using the transformer architecture, which is a type of deep learning model that is particularly well-suited for NLP tasks. 

The transformer architecture uses self-attention mechanisms to process the input data and generate output, which allows it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in the input text.

The transformer architecture consists of multiple layers of "attention" and "feedforward" blocks, which are trained to process the input data and generate output. 

The attention blocks use weighted sums to compute a weighted average of the input data, which is then used to generate the output. 

The feedforward blocks use traditional neural network techniques to process the input data and generate output.

ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in the field of NLP and Artificial Intelligence and has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers.

Regardless of your level of expertise, ChatGPT and its successors will have a significant impact on your daily life and work.
