> TL;DR: What is Object-Oriented Programming

Hello Software Designers!

# Child

[OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a programming style based on the idea of objects.

An object is a [representation](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) of something in the real-world.

OOP makes it easy to create programs that can [model real-world objects](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md). 

By using OOP, you can create programs that are easy to learn and understand.

# Teen

There are [many different ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) to write code. 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most popular and widespread.

We derive the OOP style of programming from the concept of objects.

These objects can interact with each other. 

We write the code in a special way so that the objects can work together.

OOP has many advantages over other styles of programming. 

One advantage is that it makes code easier to read and understand since it is more *declarative* (what we need) instead of *imperative* (how do we do it). 

When you look at a piece of OOP code, you can see which objects are being used and how they interact with each other. 

This makes it much easier to figure out what the code is doing than if you were looking at a bunch of unrelated lines of code.

Another advantage of OOP is that it makes code more reusable. 

If you have written a piece of code that does something useful, you can use that same code in another program without duplicating it. 

This saves you from having to write the same code again from scratch, which can save a lot of time in the long run.

Object-oriented programming is worth learning even if it takes some time to get used to at first. 

Finally, OOP can make your programs more flexible and adaptable. 

# College Student

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that is based on the concept of objects and their behavior.

We have two ways of defining an object's behavior:

- Prototyping: We can create Objects by copying other objects.

- Classifying: We create new Objects using templates called classes which define the object's characteristics. 
 
OOP code is often written in a more natural and readable fashion than procedural code. 

It also enables developers to create programs with reusable components. 

For example, we can use an object representing a bank account in many different programs without having to rewrite it each time. 

One downside is that it can be harder to learn than other styles of programming. 

The syntax (rules for writing the code) can be confusing for beginners.

Another potential drawback is that OOP programs can sometimes run more slowly than programs written in low-level styles. 

In the past, there was an extra overhead involved in keeping track of all the objects and their interactions.

This difference isn’t very significant today unless you’re working on large projects or time-critical ones.

If you’re interested in writing software that is easy to read and reuse, or if you want to be able to make changes to your programs without starting from scratch, then OOP may be right for you!

# Grad Student

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications. 

In object-oriented programming, each object is a separate entity created, manipulated, and destroyed independently.

OOP is based on the concept of objects based on the behavior of [their real counterparts](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md).

We can create Objects from scratch, or derive them from other objects. 

Once we create an object, we can use it in any number of ways.

OOP languages typically use a class system to define objects. 

A class is like a blueprint for an object, and it defines the object's collaborators and behavior. 

Each object is an instance of a class, and every object has the same structure and behavior as every other object of its class.

Classes can be organized into hierarchies or composed so that one class can inherit the behavior of another class. 

This allows for code reuse, which makes OOP very powerful.

OOP languages also support [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)).

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding code inside an object so that it can't be directly accessed or modified by outside code. 

Encapsulation helps to prevent errors and makes code easier to maintain and evolve.

If you need to make a change to your program, you change the code for one object rather than rewrite the entire program from scratch. 

This can be a huge time-saver when you’re working on large projects.

Finally, OOP can lead to more efficient code because objects can be designed to take advantage of inheritance and [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)).

# Expert 

Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming process based on the concept of objects. 

These objects are typically organized into classes, which can then be used to create individual instances of the class (called objects). 

OOP can be used to develop software that is more maintainable and easier to understand.

One of the benefits of OOP is that it can help to reduce the amount of code duplication. 

When coding using a procedural programming approach, it is easy to duplicate code when creating new functions or modules. 

This can lead to maintenance issues down the road if we need to change one piece of code, as we would need to change all instances of the duplicated code as well.

OOP can also lead to more reliable and robust code. 

This is because classes and objects can be designed in such a way that they enforce [immutability](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20Evil%20Power%20of%20Mutants/readme.md), encapsulation, [fail-fast](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Fail%20Fast/readme.md), code reuse, and information hiding. 

Favoring encapsulation, we can hide the internals of a class or object from the outside world preventing unintended side-effects from occurring.
 
Once we design and test a class or object, we can reuse it in other parts of the program without having to rewrite it.

This can save time and effort during development, as well as lead to more consistent results across the application as a whole.

[Object-Oriented Design](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Object%20Design%20Checklist/readme.md) is the cornerstone of many large software developments around the world.

Whatever your level of expertise, using OOP will enable you to build amazing systems.
