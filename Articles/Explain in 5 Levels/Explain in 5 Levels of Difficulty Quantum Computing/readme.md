*Back to the Future: Revisiting Quantum Computing 25 years later*

> TL;DR: I will explain quantum computing in five levels to different audiences.

More than 25 years ago, circa 1999, I authored an article on the future of quantum computing, which was published in the science section of a printed newspaper in Argentina.

You can access the original article [here](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/1999/suple/futuro/99-05-29/NOTA_A.HTM) (in Spanish) and view an automatic translation by following [this link](https://www-pagina12-com-ar.translate.goog/1999/suple/futuro/99-05-29/NOTA_A.HTM?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en).

My article was quite speculative back then.

Quantum computing has gained significant traction and relevance in technology discussions today.

# Child

A quantum computer is like a super-smart magic box.

Instead of using normal [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) like [regular computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), it uses special magic bits called [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit).

These qubits can do more tricks than normal bits.

Imagine you’re playing with a spinning top. A qubit is like a spinning top that can do many tricks all at the same time.

These magic computers might one day help solve impossible 100000-piece puzzles.

# Teen

Picture you can play with special building blocks used in many places simultaneously.

Quantum computers use something similar called qubits.

Think about a magic coin that can be heads and tails at the same time!

A qubit can be 0, 1, or both, like the coin spinning in the air. All at once.

This lets quantum computers explore many possibilities simultaneously.

Quantum computers are powerful because they can break secret codes like personal passwords.

It's like having a super-powerful calculator that can solve really hard puzzles much faster than regular computers.

# College Student

A quantum computer works using the principles of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics).

Instead of classical bits, you use qubits, which exist in a state of [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition).

Each qubit can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling massive parallel computation.

You can think of Schrödinger's cat - a famous thought experiment where a cat can be alive and dead at the same time.

Qubits work similarly by being in multiple states simultaneously.

Quantum computers can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers breaking public and private keys in encrypted internet connections.

This capability threatens traditional cryptography and blockchains that rely on factoring difficulty.

Researchers also explore quantum computing’s implications in multiverse theories, as qubits seemingly compute across many realities.

Recently, Google claimed a quantum computer achieved ["quantum supremacy"](https://research.google/pubs/quantum-supremacy-using-a-programmable-superconducting-processor/), solving a problem classical computers couldn’t handle in a reasonable timeframe.

A Nature study also highlighted new quantum materials to stabilize qubits.

The weird part is that these particles might suggest that many different realities exist at the same time, like parallel universes in science fiction movies!

# Graduate Student

Quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and interference.

While classical bits are binary, qubits utilize quantum superposition to represent multiple states concurrently.

[Quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) ensures qubits remain interconnected, even over distance, enabling highly efficient algorithms.

You can use quantum gates to manipulate qubits, enabling you to create quantum circuits to execute quantum algorithms.

[Shor’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) enables polynomial-time factoring of integers, directly threatening RSA cryptography and solving problems similar to [P vs NP Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem).

The complexity classes P and NP are defined on [Turing machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) and Quantum computers are not Turing machines.

Similarly, [Grover’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) provides quadratic speedups for unstructured search problems.

These advancements drive concerns about securing digital systems against quantum threats.

Multiverse speculation arises because qubits in superposition might interact with other realities, as postulated in Hugh Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation.

Meanwhile, the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) suggests quantum behavior collapses to a single outcome when you measure it.

Google’s research demonstrated [quantum supremacy (later named quantum advantage)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy) by solving a computational task in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years.

# Expert

Quantum computing pushes the principles of quantum superposition, entanglement, and unitary evolution to process information.

Qubits transcend classical logic gates by encoding information in a multidimensional [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space), enabling an exponential state space.

Algorithms like Shor’s algorithm decompose solves the hidden subgroup problem for finite abelian groups. 

semiprime integers in polynomial time, undermining cryptosystems like RSA and ECC.

Grover’s algorithm demonstrates quadratic optimization for search tasks, representing a pivotal class of quantum advantage.

Interpretations of quantum mechanics underpinning these systems differ: The Copenhagen interpretation postulates wavefunction collapse during measurement.

The [Many-Worlds Interpretation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/) suggests computational outcomes span parallel universes until observation collapses them into one.

This fuels debates on quantum parallelism across multiversal states.

Google’s demonstration of quantum supremacy leveraged a 54-qubit Sycamore processor to complete a sampling problem in 200 seconds, previously estimated to require 10,000 years on the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

This fact is disputed today and need further verification by the scientific community.

The Planck scale (10^-35 m) suggests a fundamental graininess to spacetime, potentially limiting quantum computational power.

[Warning: The Universe's Event Simulator Is a Fierce Adversary for Coders!](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Opinion/Warning%20The%20Universe's%20Event%20Simulator%20Is%20a%20Fierce%20Adversary%20for%20Coders/readme.md)

Nature reports underscore advancements in stabilizing qubits through topological quantum error correction and fault-tolerant designs, essential for practical quantum computation.
