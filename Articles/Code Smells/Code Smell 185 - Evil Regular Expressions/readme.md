# Code Smell 185 - Evil Regular Expressions
            
![Code Smell 185 - Evil Regular Expressions](Code%20Smell%20185%20-%20Evil%20Regular%20Expressions.jpg)

*Regular expressions are a code smell. Sometimes also a vulnerability*

> TL;DR: Try to minimize Regular Expression's recursive rules.

# Problems

- Security Issues

- Readability

- Premature Optimization

# Solutions

1. Cover the cases with tests to see if they halt

2. Use algorithms instead of regular expressions

3. Add timeout handlers

# Context

This is known as [ReDos](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) attack, a subtype of a [Denial of Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack.

ReDoS attacks can be divided into two types:

A string with an evil pattern is passed to an application. Then this string is used as a regex, which leads to ReDoS.

A string with a vector attack format is passed to an application. Then this string is evaluated by a vulnerable regex, which leads to ReDoS.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/a4e74fb3e18cde7ff7f15636e05ced89)
```go
func main() {
    var regularExpression = regexp.MustCompile(`^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$`)
    var candidateString = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
    for index, match := 
        range regularExpression.FindAllString(candidateString, -1) {
            fmt.Println(match, "found at index", index)
    }
}
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/4ba06d514fb663f0ee628139d463f8c7)
```go
func main() {
    var candidateString = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

    words := strings.Fields(candidateString)

    for index, word := range words {
        if len(word) >= 2 && word[0] >= ’a’ && 
            word[0] <= ’z’ && word[len(word)-1] >= ’A’
            && word[len(word)-1] <= ’Z’ {
                fmt.Println(word, "found at index", index)
        }
    }
}
```

# Detection

[X] Semi-Automatic 

Many languages avoid this kind of regular expression.

We can also scan the code for this vulnerability.

# Tags

- Security

# Conclusion

Regular Expressions are tricky and hard to debug. 

We should avoid them as much as possible.
