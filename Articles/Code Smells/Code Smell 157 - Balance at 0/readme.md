# Code Smell 157 - Balance at 0

![Code Smell 157 - Balance at 0](Code%20Smell%20157%20-%20Balance%20at%200.jpg)

*Today I expected a payment in my wallet. The balance was 0. I panicked.*

> TL;DR: Null is not 0. Error is not 0. just 0 is 0.

# Problems

- [Nulls](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Null%20-%20The%20Billion%20Dollar%20Mistake/readme.md)

- UX

- Usability

# Solutions

1. Make a clear distinction between a Zero and an error.

# Context

I read a lot about security issues. 

Especially on crypto.

Last week, I read about a [crypto hack thread](https://twitter.com/stephenlacy/status/1554697083331891201).

When my wallet showed me 0 as a balance, I panicked.

It was just a UX smell.

The blockchain was unreachable ðŸ’©

# Detection

[X] Manual

This is a design smell. 

We can find patterns when an [exception](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2073%20-%20Exceptions%20for%20Expected%20Cases/readme.md) or [return code](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2072%20-%20Return%20Codes/readme.md) is thrown and masked with a 0.

Code Smells are just my [opinion](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Blogging/I%20Wrote%20More%20than%2090%20Articles%20on%202021%20Here%20is%20What%20I%20Learned/readme.md).

> My real criticism with Null is that it brings back again unnecessarily all the agony of having to choose whether to run your program fast without checking or run it slow with checking.
