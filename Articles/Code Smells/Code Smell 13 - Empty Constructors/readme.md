# Code Smell 13 - Empty Constructors

![Code Smell 13 - Empty Constructors](Code%20Smell%2013%20-%20Empty%20Constructors.jpg)

*No-Parameterized constructors are a code smell of an **invalid** object that will dangerously mutate. Incomplete objects cause lots of issues.*

> TL;DR: Pass the essence to all your objects so they will not need to mutate.

# Problems 😔 

- Mutability

- Incomplete objects

- Concurrency inconsistencies between creation and essence setting.

- Setters

# Solutions 😃

1. Pass the object's essence on creation

2. Create objects with their immutable essence.

# Examples

- Some persistence frameworks in static typed languages require an empty constructor.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/d9d34fad693fd4f6309d68636a5010e5) -->

```javascript
class AirTicket {
   constructor() {     
  }
}
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/2e8f884045798f699399bf1ba9c26ab2) -->

```javascript
class AirTicket {
   constructor(origin,
                destination, 
                arline,
                departureTime,
                passenger) {     
     
  // ...
  }
}
```

# Detection 🔍

Any linter can warn this (possible) situation.

# Exceptions 🛑

- Stateless objects. Always better solution than static class methods.

# Tags 🏷️

- Anemic Models

# Conclusion 🏁

Always create complete objects. Make their essence immutable to endure through time.

Every object needs its essence to be a valid one since inception.

We should read Plato's ideas about immutability and create entities in a complete and immutable way.

These immutable objects favor bijection and survive the passing of time.
