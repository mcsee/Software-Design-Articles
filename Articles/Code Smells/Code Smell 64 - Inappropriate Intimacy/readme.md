# Code Smell 64 - Inappropriate Intimacy

![Code Smell 64 - Inappropriate Intimacy](Code%20Smell%2064%20-%20Inappropriate%20Intimacy.jpg)

*Two classes entangled in love.*

> TL;DR: Don't get too intimate

# Problems 😔 

- Coupling
- Bad Responsibilities Assignments
- Bad Cohesion
- Class Interfaces too Public
- Maintainability
- Extensibility

# Solutions 😃

1. Refactor

2. Merge

3. Replace Hierarchy With Delegation.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/5f9206a8a131b4dcaaa2fd64562c9eca) -->

```java
class Candidate {

 void printJobAddress(Job job) {

   System.out.println("This is your position address");

   System.out.println(job.address().street());
   System.out.println(job.address().city());
   System.out.println(job.address().zipCode());
   
   if (job.address().country() == job.country()) {
        System.out.println("It is a local job");
   } 
}
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/f94d51d327592ca511b625bac37cb441) -->

```java
final class Address {
 void print() {
   System.out.println(this.street);
   System.out.println(this.city);
   System.out.println(this.zipCode);   
 } 
 
 bool isInCounty(Country country) {
  return this.country == country;
}

class Job {
 void printAddress() {

   System.out.println("This is your position address");

   this.address().print());
   
   if (this.address().isInCountry(this.country()) {
        System.out.println("It is a local job");
   } 
 } 
}

class Candidate {
  void printJobAddress(Job job) {
    job.printAddress();
  }
}
```

# Detection 🔍

Some linters graph class relations and protocol dependency. Analyzing the collaboration graph we can infer rules and hints.

# Tags 🏷️

- Coupling

# Level 🔋

[X] Intermediate

# Conclusion 🏁

If two classes are too related and don't talk much to others we might need to split, merge or refactor them,
Classes should know as little about each other as possible. 

# Relations 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨
