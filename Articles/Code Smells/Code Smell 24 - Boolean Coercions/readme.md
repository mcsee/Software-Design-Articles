# Code Smell 24 - Boolean Coercions

![Code Smell 24 - Boolean Coercions](Code%20Smell%2024%20-%20Boolean%20Coercions.jpg)

*Booleans should be just True and False*

> TL;DR: Don't do magic castings to boolean. You will regret it on a Friday night.
 
# Problems

- Hiding Errors

- Accidental complexity coupled with one particular language.

- Readability

- Difficulty hopping among languages.

- [IFs](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/How%20to%20Get%20Rid%20of%20Annoying%20IFs%20Forever/readme.md)

# Solutions

1. Be explicit.

2. Work with booleans for boolean conditions. Not integers, not [nulls](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Null%20-%20The%20Billion%20Dollar%20Mistake/readme.md), not strings, not lists. Just booleans.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/1f5d0d7328e2e49f0695323e6c210c3e)
```python
virus = ['MERS', 'SARS']
vaccines = []
 
if vaccines:
	print ("let's get vaccinated")
else:
	print ("There are no vaccines yet. Keep researching")
    
if virus:
	print ("There are some virus around. Take extra care")
else:
	print ("You are free to get out. Not masks are necessary")

# equivalent
    
if not vaccines:
	print ("There are no vaccines yet. Keep researching")
else:
	print ("let's get vaccinated")
    
if not virus:
	print ("You are free to get out. Not masks are necessary")
else:
	print ("There are some virus around. Take extra care")
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/0c8dd91896ff91852dfa0e8711093a06)
```python
if len(vaccines) == 0:
	print ("There are no vaccines yet. Keep researching")
else:
	print ("Let's get vaccinated")    
                    
if len(virus) == 0:
	print ("You are free to get out. Not masks are necessary")
else:
	print ("There are some virus around. Take extra care")
```

# Detection

This is a language feature. Some strict languages show warnings with this magic wizardry.

# Tags

- Coercions

- Primitive

# Conclusion

Some languages encourage doing some magic abbreviations and automatic castings. This is a source of errors and a *Premature Optimization* warning.

We should always be as **explicit** as possible.
