![Code Smell 178 - Subsets Violation](Code%20Smell%20178%20-%20Subsets%20Violation.jpg)

*Invisible objects have rules we need to enforce in a single point*

> TL;DR: Create Small objects and restrict your domain.

# Problems 😔 

- [Bijection](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) Fault 

- [Fail fast principle violation](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Fail%20Fast/readme.md)

- [Repeated Code](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2046%20-%20Repeated%20Code/readme.md) validation

# Solutions 😃

1. Create small objects and validate the domain.

# Context 💬

This is a primitive obsession smell.

*EmailAddresses* are a subset of *string*.

*Valid Ages* are a subset of *Real*.

*Ports* are a subset of *Integers*.

A *wordle word* is a subset of String.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/6fedc83479a0894ca2467247ecd5e85c) -->

```java
validDestination = "destination@example.com"  
invalidDestination = "destination.example.com"
// No error is thrown
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/51ea6966c13b5aa25c34437218eef5b8) -->

```java
public class EmailAddress {
    public String emailAddress;

    public EmailAddress(String address) {
        string expressions
            = @"^\w+([-+.']\w+)*@\w+([-.]\w+)*\.\w+([-.]\w+)*$";
        if (!Regex.IsMatch(email, expressions) {
          throw new Exception('Invalid email address');
        }
        this.emailAddress = address;
    }
}

destination = new EmailAddress("destination@example.com");
```

Not to be confused with the anemic [Java version](http://officedev.github.io/ews-java-api/docs/releases/api-2.0/apidocs/microsoft/exchange/webservices/data/property/complex/EmailAddress.html)

# Detection 🔍

[X] Manual

This is a semantic smell.

# Tags 🏷️

- Primitive Obsession

# Conclusion 🏁

We need to be loyal to the bijection of the real-world. 

Subsets are very important for early validations and fail fast principle.
