[](){}

/* This valid lambda function:

Captures no variables.
Takes no arguments.
Performs no actions.

[]: This is the capture clause. 
It specifies which variables from the surrounding scope
are accessible inside the lambda function. 
An empty capture clause [] means the lambda
*doesn't capture* any variables from the surrounding scope.

(): This is the parameter list. 
It defines the arguments the lambda function accepts. 
An empty () means the lambda takes *no parameters*.

{}: This is the function body. 
It contains the code that the lambda executes when called. 
An empty {} means the lambda has no operations 
to perform—it does nothing.
