![Code Smell 171 - Plural Classes](Code%20Smell%20171%20-%20Plural%20Classes.jpg)

*Classes are my precious*

> TL;DR: Classes represent concepts. And concepts are singular.

# Problems 😔 

- Naming

- Code Standards

# Solutions 😃

1. Rename classes to singular

# Context 💬

Naming things is hard.

We need to agree on certain rules.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/5d0c869a94d623684baefce9897563e2) -->

```scala
class Users
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/34c2fa54fa1629971b55d084541e9ce2) -->

```scala
class User
```

# Detection 🔍

[X] Automatic 

This is a syntactic rule.

# Tags 🏷️

- Naming

# Conclusion 🏁

Name concepts in the singular.

Classes are concepts.
