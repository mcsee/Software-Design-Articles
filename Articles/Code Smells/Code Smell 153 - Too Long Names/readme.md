![Code Smell 153 - Too Long Names](Code%20Smell%20153%20-%20Too%20Long%20Names.jpg)

*Names should be long and descriptive. How Long?*

> TL;DR: Names should be long enough. No longer.

# Problems 😔 

- Readability

- Cognitive Load

# Solutions 😃

1. Use names related to the [MAPPER](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md)

# Context 💬

We used [very short names](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2033%20-%20Abbreviations/readme.md) during the 50s and 60s due to space and time constraints.

This is no longer the case in modern languages.

Sometimes we get too excited.

Naming is an art and we should be cautious with it.

Just Heuristics.
