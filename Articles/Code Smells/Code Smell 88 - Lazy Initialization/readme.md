# Code Smell 88 - Lazy Initialization

![Code Smell 88 - Lazy Initialization](Code%20Smell%2088%20-%20Lazy%20Initialization.jpg)

*Yet another premature optimization pattern*

> TL;DR: Do not use lazy initialization. Use an object provider instead.

# Problems 😔 

- Surprising Side Effects

- Premature Optimization

- Fail Fast Violation

- Implementative Coupling

- The Least Surprise Principle Violation

- [Null Usage](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Null%20-%20The%20Billion%20Dollar%20Mistake/readme.md)

- Mutability

- Transactional and Multi-threaded applications problems

# Solutions 😃

1. Inject Responsibilities with First Class Objects

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/0d762f54e37352ed72eee7e77d0ae5e0) -->

```ruby
class Employee
  def emails
    @emails ||= []
  end
  
  def voice_mails
    @voice_mails ||= []
  end
end
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/dbd08513d5005325e63954515052555d) -->

```ruby
class Employee
  attr_reader :emails, :voice_mails

  def initialize
    @emails = []
    @voice_mails = []
  end
end
# You can also inject a design pattern to externally deal
# with voice_mails so you can mock it in your tests
```

# Detection 🔍

Lazy initialization is a common pattern when used checking for a non-initialized variable. 

It should be straightforward to detect them.

# Conclusion 🏁

[Singletons](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Singleton%20-%20The%20Root%20of%20All%20Evil/readme.md) are another anti-pattern often combined with lazy initialization.

We must avoid premature optimizations. If we have *real* performance problems we should use a Proxy, Facade or more independent solution.
