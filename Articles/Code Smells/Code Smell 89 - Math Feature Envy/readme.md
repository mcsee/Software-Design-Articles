# Code Smell 89 - Math Feature Envy

![Code Smell 89 - Math Feature Envy](Code%20Smell%2089%20-%20Math%20Feature%20Envy.jpg)

*One class calculates formulas for another class.*

> TL;DR: Leave the formulas to the objects gathering the information.

# Problems 😔 

- Declaratively

- Low reuse

- Real-world concept missing

- Encapsulation

# Solutions 😃

1. Move the math formula to the class

2. Search for [real-world abstractions](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md)

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/4b3483f5be825913df7a6c709efebdbc) -->

```javascript
function area(rectangle) { 
    return rectangle.width * rectangle.height;
    // Notice that you are sending consecutive messages to
    // the same object and doing calculations
}
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/891b1df84cd9e0528fad2dae42322c54) -->

```javascript
class Rectangle {
    constructor(width, height) { 
         this.height = height;
         this.width = width;
    }
 
    area() {
        return this.width * this.height;
    }
}
```

# Detection 🔍

Since many cascading messages are sending to the same object, we can detect a pattern.

- Coupling

# Level 🔋

[X] Beginner

# Conclusion 🏁

This is a very basic smell. If we are manipulating another object's characteristics, we should let it do it the maths for us.
