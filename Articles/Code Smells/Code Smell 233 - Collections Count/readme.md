# Code Smell 233 - Collections Count
            
![Code Smell 233 - Collections Count](Code%20Smell%20233%20-%20Collections%20Count.jpg)

*You count collections or collections.count?*

> TL;DR: Chose narrow names

# Problems

- Bad Naming

# Solutions

1. Accurately describe your collections

# Context

Names are significant and should not deceive the reader.
												f
You name things and lose the scope of the name. 

It is important to be accurate of the expected reference on the names.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/75e43eb48e025f1e41e65c1e7439c7b7)
```javascript
const standardModelParticles = {
  quarks: [
    {
      name: "Up",
      charge: "2/3",
      type: "Quark",
    },
    {
      name: "Down",
      charge: "-1/3",
      type: "Quark",
    },
    // ...
  ],
  leptons: [
    {
      name: "Electron",
      charge: "-1",
      type: "Lepton",
    },
    {
      name: "Muon",
      charge: "-1",
      type: "Lepton",
    },
    // ...
  ],
  gaugeBosons: [
    {
      name: "Photon",
      charge: "0",
      type: "Boson",
    },
    {
      name: "W Boson",
      charge: "Â±1",
      type: "Boson",
    },
    // ...
  ],
  higgsBoson: [
    {
      name: "Higgs Boson",
      charge: "0",
      type: "Scalar Boson",
    },
  ],
};
 
const quarks = standardModelParticles.quarks.length; 
// Bad name. It does not represent a count
// But a Collection of things
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/8b0d7ed980f656ff26f070e228fbc760)
```javascript
const standardModelParticles = {
}; // Same as the "Wrong" example
 
const quarksCount = standardModelParticles.quarks.length; 
```

# Detection

[X] Semi-Automatic 

Some linters can check the types and names and infer a mistake

# Tags

- Namings

# Conclusion

Take care of your names.

Use automatic refactor tools whenever you come across a bad name.
