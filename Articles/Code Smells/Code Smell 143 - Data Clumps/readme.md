# Code Smell 143 - Data Clumps

![Code Smell 143 - Data Clumps](Code%20Smell%20143%20-%20Data%20Clumps.jpg)

*Some objects are always together. Why don't we split them?*

> TL;DR: Make cohesive primitive objects travel together

# Problems 😔 

- Bad Cohesion

- Duplicated Code

- Validation Complexity

- Readability

- Maintainability

# Solutions 😃

1. Extract Class

2. Find small objects

# Context 💬

This smell is friends with primitive obsession. 

If two or more primitive objects are glued together, with business logic repeated and rules between them, we need to find the existing concept on the [bijection](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md).

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/076c003ce49b9fc4af66f4dffeb71079) -->

```csharp
public class DinnerTable
{
    public DinnerTable(Person guest, DateTime from, DateTime to)
    {
        Guest = guest; 
        From = from;
        To = to;
    }
    private Person Guest;
    private DateTime From; 
    private DateTime To;
}
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/a848e76a45559291a2f71cd76aa91961) -->

```csharp
public class TimeInterval
{
    public TimeInterval(DateTime from, DateTime to)
    {
        if (from >= to)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException
                ("Invalid time interval:" + 
                 " ’from’ must be earlier than ’to’.");
        }
        From = from;
        To = to;
    }
}

public DinnerTable(Person guest, DateTime from, DateTime to)
{    
    Guest = guest;
    Interval = new TimeInterval(from, to);
}

// Even Better...

public DinnerTable(Person guest, Interval reservationTime)
{    
    Guest = guest;
    Interval = reservationTime;
}
```

# Detection 🔍

[X] Semi-Automatic 

Detection based on cohesion patterns is available o a few linters.

# Tags 🏷️

- Cohesion

# Conclusion 🏁

Group behavior in the right place and hide the primitive data.
