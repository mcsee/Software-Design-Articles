![Code Smell 204 - Tests Depending on Dates](Code%20Smell%20204%20-%20Tests%20Depending%20on%20Dates.jpg)

*It is a good idea to assert something has happened in the future*

> TL;DR: Tests must be in full control, and you can't manage time.

# Problems 😔 

- Fragile Tests

- CI/CD Breaks

# Solutions 😃

1. Tests should be always in full environmental control.

2. Create a time source

# Context 💬

I read a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1639975667713409030) about adding a fixed date to check for the removal of a feature flag (which is another [code smell](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2029%20-%20Settings%20-%20Configs/readme.md)).
The test will fail in an unpredictable way preventing releases and breaking CI/CD pipeline.
There are also other bad examples we will never reach some date, tests running at midnight, different timezones, etc.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/7e96669a0239ea203c90423e2e08b22d) -->

```java
class DateTest {
    @Test
    void testNoFeatureFlagsAfterFixedDate() {
        LocalDate fixedDate = LocalDate.of(2023, 4, 4);
        LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now();        
        Assertions.assertTrue(currentDate.isBefore(fixedDate) ||
           !featureFlag.isOn());
    }
}
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/3ccfe6623e9eea63c135afa59c4dbf4f) -->

```java
class DateTest {
    @Test
    void testNoFeatureFlags() {   
        Assertions.assertFalse(featureFlag.isOn());
    }
}
```

# Detection 🔍

[X] Semi-Automatic 

We can check assertions based on time on our tests.

# Conclusion 🏁

Proceed with caution with tests and dates. 

They are often a cause of mistakes.
