# Code Smell 86 - Mutable Const Arrays

![Code Smell 86 - Mutable Const Arrays](Code%20Smell%2086%20-%20Mutable%20Const%20Arrays.jpg)

*Const declares something to be constant. Can it mutate?*

> TL;DR: Don't rely on languages cheating about directives.

# Problems

- Unexpected side effects

- Accidental complexity

# Solutions

1. Use better languages

2. Use [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/03563ad0268ac240336fcab195f8da29)
```javascript
const array = [1, 2];

array.push(3)

// array => [1, 2, 3]
// Wasn't it constant ?
// constant != immutable ?
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/c1610a6305aa2a1f3b9add686652d0b7)
```javascript
const array = [1, 2];

const newArray = [...array,3 ]

// array => [1, 2] Didn't mutate
// newArray = [1, 2, 3]
```

# Detection

Since this is a "language feature", we can explicitly forbid it.

# Tags

- Mutability

- JavaScript

# Conclusion

We should always favour immutability on our designs and take extra care with side effects.
