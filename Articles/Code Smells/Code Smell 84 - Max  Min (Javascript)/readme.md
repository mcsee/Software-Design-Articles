# Code Smell 84 - Max < Min (Javascript)

![Code Smell 84 - Max < Min (Javascript)](Code%20Smell%2084%20-%20Max%20%20Min%20(Javascript).jpg)

*Some functions do not behave as expected. Sadly, most programmers accept them.*

> TL;DR: Don't trust max() and min() functions. Just ignore them.

# Problems 😔 

- Principle of the least astonishment

- [Bijection](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) Violation.

- Unexpected Results

# Solutions 😃

1. Use mature languages.

2. Avoid *max()* and *min()* functions.

3. Model Infinites carefully.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/8440adc57486989468045de4df3c9bef) -->

```javascript
console.log(Math.max() > Math.min());

// returns false

console.log(Math.max());

// returns -Infinite
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/7f275da71e96bd4050e17c0ec7511c14) -->

```javascript
console.log(Math.max() > Math.min());
console.log(Math.max());

// returns Exception. Not enough arguments passed.
// Max requires at least one argument
```

# Detection 🔍

These functions belong to the standard Math library. Therefore, they are not easy to avoid. 

We can block them on our linters.

# Level 🔋

[x] Intermediate

# Conclusion 🏁

We need to be very careful using functions that violate real-world concepts using language tricks.
