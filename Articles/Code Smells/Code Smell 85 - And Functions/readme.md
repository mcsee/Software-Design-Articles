# Code Smell 85 - And Functions

![Code Smell 85 - And Functions](Code%20Smell%2085%20-%20And%20Functions.jpg)

*Do not perform more than requested.*

> TL;DR: Unless you need atomicity, do not perform more than one task.

# Problems

- Coupling
- Single Responsibility Principle violation
- Readability
- Low Cohesion
- Testability

# Solutions

1. Break the function

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/059b9deb2e9e13c94a724b82e54f6fda)
```python
def fetch_and_display_personnel():
  data = # ...
  
  for person in data:
    print(person)
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/47a1f8cd217afd58bc47b373b91593ef)
```python
def fetch_personnel():
  return # ...

def display_personnel(data):
  for person in data:
    print(person)
```

# Detection

Functions including "and" are candidates. However, we need to check them carefully since there might be false positives.

# Tags

- Readability
- Naming

# Conclusion

We should avoid doing more than needed, and our functions should be both minimal and atomic.
