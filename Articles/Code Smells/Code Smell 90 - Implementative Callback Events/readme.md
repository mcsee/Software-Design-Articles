# Code Smell 90 - Implementative Callback Events

![Code Smell 90 - Implementative Callback Events](Code%20Smell%2090%20-%20Implementative%20Callback%20Events.jpg)

*When creating events, we should decouple the trigger from the action.*

> TL;DR: Name your functions according to what happened.

# Problems 😔 

- [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) violation

- Coupling

# Solutions 😃

1. Name the events after "what happened", not "what you should do". 

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/0a96468b7877744c0ec41d60378df4cd) -->

```javascript
const Item = ({name, handlePageChange)} =>
  <li onClick={handlePageChange}>
    {name}
  </li>

// handlePageChange is coupled with what you decide to do
// instead of what really happened
//
// You cannot reuse this kind of callback
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/185fef9ac202fed779fcf8a6c8f0bac3) -->

```javascript
const Item = ({name, onItemSelected)} =>
  <li onClick={onItemSelected}>
    {name}
  </li>

// onItemSelected will be called just when an item was selected. KISS
// Parent can decide what to do (or do nothing)
// You defer the decision
```

# Detection 🔍

This is a semantic smell. We can detect it on peer code reviews.

# Conclusion 🏁

Names are very important. We should delay implementation coupled names until the very last moment.
