![Code Smell 176 - Changes in Essence](Code%20Smell%20176%20-%20Changes%20in%20Essence.jpg)

*Mutation is good. Things change*

> TL;DR: Don't change essential attributes or behavior

# Problems 😔 

- [Bijection](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) violation

- [Mutability](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20Evil%20Power%20of%20Mutants/readme.md)

- [Ripple Effect](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2016%20-%20Ripple%20Effect/readme.md)

# Solutions 😃

1. Protect essential attributes from change.

2. [Remove setters](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Refactorings/Refactoring%20001%20-%20Remove%20Setters/readme.md)

# Context 💬

Heraclitus said:

> No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.

The man stays the same in essence. But his body evolves.

# Detection 🔍

[X] Manual

This is a semantic smell. We need to model which attributes/behaviors are [essential](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/No%20Silver%20Bullet/readme.md) and which are accidental.

# Tags 🏷️

- [Mutability](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20Evil%20Power%20of%20Mutants/readme.md) 

# Conclusion 🏁

We need to favor immutable objects.

Objects can mutate in [accidental](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/No%20Silver%20Bullet/readme.md) ways, not in essential ones.
