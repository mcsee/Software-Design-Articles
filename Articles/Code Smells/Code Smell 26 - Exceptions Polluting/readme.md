# Code Smell 26 - Exceptions Polluting

![Code Smell 26 - Exceptions Polluting](Code%20Smell%2026%20-%20Exceptions%20Polluting.jpg)

*It is very nice to have lots of different exceptions. Your code is declarative and robust. Or not?*

> TL;DR: Don't create anemic and empty objects. Even if they are Exceptions.
 
# Problems

- Over Design

- Namespace Pollution

- [Empty Classes](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%20114%20-%20Empty%20Class/readme.md)

# Solutions

1. Avoid creating [anemic](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2001%20-%20Anemic%20Models/readme.md) exceptions as globals.

2. Create exceptions only if they behave differently.

3. Model exceptions with objects. Classes are handy for lazy programmers.

4. [Remove Unhandled Exceptions](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Refactorings/Refactoring%20004%20-%20Remove%20Unhandled%20Exceptions/readme.md)

public class FileReader {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileReader file = null;

        try {

            file.read();
        }
        catch(FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        catch(FileLockedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        catch(FilePermissionsException e) {

# Detection

New exceptions should override behavior methods. 

No. *code*, *description*, *resumable*, etc. are not behavioral.

# Tags

- Abuser

- Naming

# Conclusion

You would not create different classes for every Person instance, so they return different names. Why would you do it with exceptions.

How often do you catch a specific exception?. 

Go out and check your code. 

Is it necessary to be a class? 

You are already coupled to the class. Couple to the description instead. 

Exception instances should **NOT** be [Singletons](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Singleton%20-%20The%20root%20of%20all%20evil/readme.md).
