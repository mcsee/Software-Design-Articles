# Code Smell 222 - Comma Operator
            
![Code Smell 222 - Comma Operator](Code%20Smell%20222%20-%20Comma%20Operator.jpg)

*Don't abuse this fancy operator*

> TL;DR: Use comma operator just for loops

# Problems

- Readability

- Hidden Defects

# Solutions

1. Avoid operator usage

2. Prefer *[foreach](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2053%20-%20Explicit%20Iteration/readme.md)* operator

3. Break the sentences

# Context

In JavaScript, the comma operator allows you to evaluate multiple expressions sequentially and return the value of the last expression.

It's denoted by a comma and separates multiple expressions within a larger expression.

Each expression is evaluated in order from left to right, and the final value of the entire comma-separated expression is the value of the last expression.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/b18abdb155a811f6f3f694b079837330) -->

```javascript
const gravitationalConstant = 6.67430e-11;

const massBlackHole1 = 1.5e31;  
// Mass of the first black hole in kg

const massBlackHole2 = 2.2e32;  
// Mass of the second black hole in kg

const distanceBlackHoles = 5.7e20;  
// Distance between black holes in meters

var force = (distanceSquared = distanceBlackHoles*distanceBlackHoles,
            (gravitationalConstant * massBlackHole1*massBlackHole2) /
             distanceSquared);
// Two operations in a single statement with comma operator
```

## Right

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/3a928ca6aa06e70c0f20d40487c6bad9) -->

```javascript
function calculateGravitationalForce(mass1, mass2, distance) {
  const gravitationalConstant = 6.67430e-11;
  return (gravitationalConstant * mass1 * mass2) / 
    (distance * distance);  
}

const massBlackHole1 = 1.5e31; 
// Mass of the first black hole in kg

const massBlackHole2 = 2.2e32; 
// Mass of the second black hole in kg

const distanceBlackHoles = 5.7e20; 
// Distance between black holes in meters

const force = calculateGravitationalForce(
  massBlackHole1,
  massBlackHole2,
  distanceBlackHoles
);
// Notice force is calculated with a separate function
```

# Detection

[X] Automatic 

Many [linters](https://rules.sonarsource.com/javascript/RSPEC-878/) can detect this problem.

# Exceptions

- For loops are a valid exception dough they might lead you to [another code smell](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2053%20-%20Explicit%20Iteration/readme.md)

# Tags

- Readability

# Conclusion

This valid operator was designed to shorten *for loops* but is now sometimes abused.
