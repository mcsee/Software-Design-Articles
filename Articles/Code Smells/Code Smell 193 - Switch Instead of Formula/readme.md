*Which is better, declarative or shorter code?*

> TL;DR: Be declarative enough but no more.

# Problems 😔 

- Readability

- [Premature Optimization](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2020%20-%20Premature%20Optimization/readme.md)

# Solutions 😃

1. Use a short version (or not).

2. Always favor readability >> Premature optimization.

3. Humans learn by examples, not by formulas.

4. Shorter is not always better.

# Context 💬

Last week, a tweet went viral because of a missing formula.

It is the DigiD digital authentication iOS app in the Netherlands.

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/0a2979db94ff5288a342e2846155d955) -->

```csharp

        {
            if (percentage == 0)
                return "⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪";
            if (percentage > 0.0 && percentage <= 0.1)
                return "🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪";

## Right?

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/e24ffc9ad7e587f44862ed7dff22e1b7) -->

```csharp
private static string GetPercentageRounds(double percentage)
{
    string dots = "🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪";
    int blueDots = (int) Math.Truncate (percentage* 10);
    int startingPoint = 10-blueDots;
    return dots. Substring(startingPoint, 10);
}

# Conclusion 🏁

You can read the original [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JeroenFrijters/status/1615204074588180481) to take your own conclusions. There's some serious debate and, of course, several premature optimizators bringing obscure and unneeded solutions with *(O) log(n)* complexity and stupid benchmarks evidence for a loop that executes only once.

And lots of memes.

As a final conclusion, I asked [ChatGPT](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/ChatGPT%20The%20Surprising%20Teacher%20of%20a%20+25%20Year%20Senior%20Programmer/readme.md) and was not able to simplify it.
