# Code Smell 226 - Mixed Priorities
            
![Code Smell 226 - Mixed Priorities](Code%20Smell%20226%20-%20Mixed%20Priorities.jpg)

*Another crashed spacecraft. Another software problem*

> TL;DR: Design and test the software. It is cheaper than the hardware

# Problems

- [Bijection](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) Fault

- Unexpected Defects

# Solutions

1. Create accurate simulations

2. Make [fault-tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) software

# Context

[Luna-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_25) crashed on the moon's surface on August 19, 2023. 

4 days before India’s [Chandrayaan-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-3) soft landed on Moon's south pole.

A [forensic analysis](https://t.me/roscosmos_gk/11053) revealed that the instructions shared a bus and were not prioritized correctly.

Spacecrafts have a [long history](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Coupling%20-%20The%20one%20and%20only%20software%20design%20problem/readme.md) of software faults.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/e828fb96c53f62f62b40dc70bc1b02ee) -->

```python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task, priority):
        self.tasks.append((task, priority))

    def execute_tasks(self):
        # No sorting

        for task, _ in self.tasks:
            task.execute()

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def execute(self):
        print(f"Executing task: {self.name}")

task_manager = TaskManager()
highPriorityTask = Task("Slow down")
mediumPriorityTask = Task("Take Photos")
reviveKlaatu = Task("Klaatu barada nikto")

# unsorted
task_manager.add_task(mediumPriorityTask, 2)
task_manager.add_task(highPriorityTask, 1)
task_manager.add_task(reviveKlaatu, 3)

task_manager.execute_tasks()
```
