# Code Smell 199 - Gratuitous Booleans
            
![Code Smell 199 - Gratuitous Booleans](Code%20Smell%20199%20-%20Gratuitous%20Booleans.jpg)

*A code that either returns or no returns at all*

> TL;DR: Check carefully your boolean expressions

# Problems

- Readability

- Possible Defects

# Solutions

1. Refactor and remove obsolete code

# Context

When a function is designed to return an invariant value, it may be poor design, but it shouldnâ€™t adversely affect the outcome of your program. However, when it happens on all paths through the logic, it is likely a mistake.

This rule raises an issue when a function contains several return statements that all return the same value.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/dc73985cd7ff45aa7496f41f96e81fe3)
```python
# Gratuitous boolean expressions

if a > 0 and True:
    # This code was left on debugging and passed
    # by mistake during code reviews
    print("a is positive")
else:
    print("a is not positive")

```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/c8d0be601736520faa86a8d7e781be2f)
```python
if a > 0:
    print("a is positive")
else:
    print("a is not positive")
```

# Detection

[X] Automatic 

Many [linters](https://rules.sonarsource.com/javascript/type/Code%20Smell/RSPEC-2589) can detect this problem by parsing execution trees.

# Tags

- Complexity

# Conclusion

Boolean expressions should be straightforward to read and understand.
