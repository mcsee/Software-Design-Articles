# Code Smell 36 - Switch/case/elseif/else/if statements

![Code Smell 36 - Switch/case/elseif/else/if statements](Code%20Smell%2036%20-%20Switch%20case%20elseif%20else%20if%20statements.jpg)

*First programming lesson: Control structures. Senior developer lesson: avoid them.*

> TL;DR: Don use Ifs or its friends

# Problems 😔 

- Too many decisions together

- Coupling

- Duplicated code

- Violation of [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle).

- A new condition should not change the main algorithm.

- Nulls

# Solutions 😃

1. Polymorphism

2. Create hierarchies/compose objects following *Open closed principle*.

3. Use [State pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) to model transitions.

4. Use [Strategy Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)/[Method Object](https://wiki.c2.com/?MethodObject) to choose for branches.

# Examples

- Discrete Values

- State transition

- Algorithm choice.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/fd1c07ce153817a5572cb3cb84ae1007) -->

```javascript
class Mp3Converter {
  convertToMp3(source, mimeType) {
    if(mimeType.equals("audio/mpeg")) {
        this.convertMpegToMp3(source)
    } else if(mimeType.equals("audio/wav")) {
        this.convertWavToMp3(source)
    } else if(mimeType.equals("audio/ogg")) {
        this.convertOggToMp3(source)
    } else if(...) {
        // Lots of new clauses
}
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/ef02daf9882bbf6a6f12820b31e19920) -->

```javascript
class Mp3Converter {
  convertToMp3(source, mimeType) {
    const foundConverter = this.registeredConverters.
        find(converter => converter.handles(mimeType));
        // Do not use metaprogramming to find and iterate converters
        // since this is another problem.    
    if (!foundConverter) {
      throw new Error('No converter found for ' + mimeType);
    }    
    foundConverter.convertToMp3(source);
  }
}
```

# Detection 🔍

Since there are [valid cases](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/How%20to%20Get%20Rid%20of%20Annoying%20IFs%20Forever/readme.md) for If/else usages, we should not pull the plug and forbid these instructions. We can put a ratio of if statements/other statements as a warning instead.

# Conclusion 🏁

Switches and if-else chains often disguise deep structural problems in code. 

When you replace them with polymorphism, state, or strategy patterns, you enhance flexibility, reduce duplication, and adhere to the Open/Closed Principle.

Control structures overuse or misuse leads to brittle, hard-to-maintain systems.
