# Code Smell 168 - Undocumented Decisions
            
![Code Smell 168 - Undocumented Decisions](Code%20Smell%20168%20-%20Undocumented%20Decisions.jpg)

*We need to make some changes. We need to be clear on why*

> TL;DR: Be declarative on your design or implementation decisions.

# Problems

- Code Comments

- Lack of testability

# Solutions

1. Be Explicit about the reasons.

2. Convert the comment to a method.

# Context

Sometimes we find arbitrary rules not so easily testable. 

If we cannot write a failing test, we need to have a function with an excellent and declarative name instead of a comment.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/554144e5e61703b8a556328671b0a3dd) -->

```c
// You need to run this process with more memory
set_memory("512k");
           
run_process();
```

## Right

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/ab76cec5efd320d5cf9a2e626343d3e8) -->

```c
increase_memory_to_avoid_false_positives();
run_process();
```

# Detection

[X] Semi-Automatic 

This is a semantic smell.

We can detect comments and warn us.

# Tags

- Comments

# Conclusion

Code is prose. And design decisions should be narrative.
