# Code Smell 80 - Nested Try/Catch

![Code Smell 80 - Nested Try/Catch](Code%20Smell%2080%20-%20Nested%20Try%20Catch.jpg)

*Exceptions are a great way of separating happy path versus trouble path. But we tend to over-complicate our solutions.*

> TL;DR: Don't nest Exceptions. Nobody cares of what you do in the inner blocks.

# Problems 😔 

- Readability

# Solutions 😃

1. Refactor

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/f180d0e09abe6dc0f637a142c4a5a58b) -->

```javascript
try {
    transaction.commit();
} catch (e) {
    logerror(e);
    if (e instanceOf DBError) {
      try {
          transaction.rollback();
      } catch (e) {
          doMoreLoggingRollbackFailed(e);
      }
    }
}

// Nested Try catches
// Exception cases are more important than the happy path
// You use exceptions as control flow
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/a4fc40e63f2506bf02144c9f71f164a3) -->

```javascript
try {
    transaction.commit();
} catch (transactionError) {
    this.withTransactionErrorDo(
        transationError, transaction);
}

// transaction error policy is not defined in this function
// so you don't have repeated code and code is more readable
// It is up to the transaction and the error to decide what to do
```

# Detection 🔍

We can detect this smell using parsing trees.

# Conclusion 🏁

Don't abuse exceptions, don't create Exception classes no one will ever catch, and don't be prepared for every case (unless you have a good real scenario with a covering test).

The happy path should always be more important than exception cases.
