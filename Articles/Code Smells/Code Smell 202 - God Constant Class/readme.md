# Code Smell 202 - God Constant Class
            
![Code Smell 202 - God Constant Class](Code%20Smell%20202%20-%20God%20Constant%20Class.jpg)

*Constants should be together to find them easily*

> TL;DR: Don't define too many unrelated constants in the same class. Don't pile up the junk together.

# Problems

- Bad Cohesion

- High Coupling

- Magic Numbers

- Single Responsibility principle violation

# Solutions

1. Break the contents following Real World responsibilities using the [MAPPER](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md).

# Context

This is a special case of a God Object restricted only to constant definitions.

The repository can be a class, file, or JSON. 

# Sample Code

## Wrong

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/402d6689b9a9bdef6a0cedf4e8974805) -->

```javascript
public static class GlobalConstants
{
   public const int MaxPlayers = 10;
   public const string DefaultLanguage = "en-US";
   public const double Pi = 3.14159;
}
```

## Right

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/d26aa5ca0e29c906689c7e0b3be8cd54) -->

```javascript
public static class GameConstants
{
    public const int MaxPlayers = 10;
}

public static class LanguageConstants
{
    public const string DefaultLanguage = "en-US";
}

public static class MathConstants
{
    public const double Pi = 3.14159;
}
```

# Detection

[X] Semi-Automatic

We can tell our linters to warn us of too many constants' definitions against a preset threshold. 

# Tags

- Coupling

# Conclusion

Finding correct responsibilities is one of our primary tasks when designing software.
