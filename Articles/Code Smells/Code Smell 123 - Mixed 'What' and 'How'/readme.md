# Code Smell 123 - Mixed 'What' and 'How'

![Code Smell 123 - Mixed 'What' and 'How'](Code%20Smell%20123%20-%20Mixed%20'What'%20and%20'How'.jpg)

*We love looking at the internal gears of the clock, but we need to start focusing on the hands.*

> TL;DR: Don't mess with implementation details. Be declarative. Not imperative.

# Problems

- Accidental Coupling

- [Coupling](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Coupling%20-%20The%20one%20and%20only%20software%20design%20problem/readme.md)

- Lack of design for change

- [Comments](https://twitter.com/TonyFlury/status/1103649549355233280) distinguish the 'how' and the 'what'.

# Solutions

1. Separate 'What' and 'How' concerns. 

# Context

Separating concerns is very difficult in the software industry.

Functional software survives ages.

Implementative software brings coupling and is harder to change.

Choosing wise declarative names is a daily challenge.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/d6d3df14e1268f9308fdd2121ccd598d)
```javascript
class Workflow {
    moveToNextTransition() {
        // We couple the business rule with the accidental implementation
        if (this.stepWork.hasPendingTasks) {
            throw new Exception('Preconditions are not met yet..');
        } else {
            this.moveToNextStep();
        }
    }
}
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/4fb3c004b00d81cfb1749bd22394772c)
```javascript
class Workflow {
    moveToNextTransition() {
        if (!this.canWeMoveOn()) {
            throw new Exception('Preconditions are not met yet..');
        } else {
            this.moveToNextStep();
        }
    }

    canWeMoveOn() {
        // We hide accidental implementation 'the how'
        // under the 'what'
        return !this.stepWork.hasPendingTasks();
    }
}
```

# Detection

[X] Manual

This is a semantic and naming smell.

# Tags

- Readability

# Conclusion

We need to choose good names and add indirection layers when necessary.

Of course, *[premature optimizators](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Blogging/I%20Wrote%20More%20than%2090%20Articles%20on%202021%20Here%20is%20What%20I%20Learned/readme.md)* will fight us, telling us we are wasting computational resources and they need to know the insights we are hiding from them.
