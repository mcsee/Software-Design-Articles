# Code Smell 123 - Mixed 'What' and 'How'

![Code Smell 123 - Mixed 'What' and 'How'](josh-redd-u_RiRTA_TtY-unsplash.jpg)

*We love looking at the internal gears of the clock, but we need to start focusing on the hands.*

> TL;DR: Don't mess with implementation details. Be declarative. Not imperative.

# Problems

- Accidental Coupling

- [Coupling](Theory\Coupling - The one and only software design problem)

- Lack of design for change

- [Comments](https://twitter.com/TonyFlury/status/1103649549355233280) distinguish the 'how' and the 'what'.

# Solutions

1. Separate 'What' and 'How' concerns. 

# Context

Separating concerns is very difficult in the software industry.

Functional software survives ages.

Implementative software brings coupling and is harder to change.

Choosing wise declarative names is a daily challenge.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/d6d3df14e1268f9308fdd2121ccd598d)
```javascript
class Workflow {
    moveToNextTransition() {
        // We couple the business rule with the accidental implementation
        if (this.stepWork.hasPendingTasks) {
            throw new Exception('Preconditions are not met yet..');
        } else {
            this.moveToNextStep();
        }
    }
}
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/4fb3c004b00d81cfb1749bd22394772c)
```javascript
class Workflow {
    moveToNextTransition() {
        if (!this.canWeMoveOn()) {
            throw new Exception('Preconditions are not met yet..');
        } else {
            this.moveToNextStep();
        }
    }

    canWeMoveOn() {
        // We hide accidental implementation 'the how'
        // under the 'what'
        return !this.stepWork.hasPendingTasks();
    }
}
```

# Detection

[X] Manual

This is a semantic and naming smell.

# Tags

- Readability

# Conclusion

We need to choose good names and add indirection layers when necessary.

Of course, *[premature optimizators](Blogging\I Wrote More than 90 Articles on 2021 Here is What I Learned)* will fight us, telling us we are wasting computational resources and they need to know the insights we are hiding from them.

> We are constantly interfacing with other people's code that might not live up to our high standards and dealing with inputs that may or may not be valid. So we are taught to code defensively. We use assertions to detect bad data and check for consistency.
