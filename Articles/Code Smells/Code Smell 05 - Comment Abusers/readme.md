# Code Smell 05 - Comment Abusers

![Code Smell 05 - Comment Abusers](Code%20Smell%2005%20-%20Comment%20Abusers.jpg)

*The code has lots of comments. 
Comments are coupled to implementation and hardly maintained.*

> TL;DR: Leave comments just for important design decisions. Don't explain the obvious.

# Problems

- Maintainability

- Obsolete Documentation

- Readability

- Code and comments duplication.

# Solutions

1) Refactor methods.

2) Rename methods to more declarative ones.

3) Break methods.

4) If a comment describes what a method does, [name the method with this description](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Refactorings/Refactoring%20005%20-%20Replace%20Comment%20with%20Function%20Name/readme.md).

5) Just comment on important design decisions.

```php
<?

final class ChatBotConnectionHelper {
    // ChatBotConnectionHelper is used
    // to create connection strings to Bot Platform
    // Use this class with getString() function
    // to get connection string to platform

    function getString() {
        // Get Connection String from Chatbot
    }
}
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/698102c04428aec69356cad26d4c50cd)

```php
<?

final class ChatBotConnectionSequenceGenerator {

    }
}
```

# Detection

Linters can detect comments and check the ratio of comments/lines of code against a predefined threshold.

# Conclusion

Leave comments just for important design decisions. Don't comment on a method with a bad name, rename it.

> If you have to spend effort looking at a fragment of code and figuring out what itâ€™s doing, then you should extract it into a function and name the function after the what.
