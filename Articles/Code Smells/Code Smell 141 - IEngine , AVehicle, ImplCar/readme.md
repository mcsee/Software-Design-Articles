*Have you ever seen an IEngine in the wild?*

> TL;DR: Don't prefix or suffix your classes

# Problems

- Readability

- [Bijection](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) Fault

- Implementative Names

# Solutions

1. Remove prefixes and suffixes

2. Name your objects after what they do

# Context

Some languages have cultural conventions related to data types, Abstract classes, or Interfaces.

These names load our models with cognitive translations hard to follow. 

We must [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/00b852bfb884a47c5d7adf0543ec3a61)
```java
public interface IEngine
{
    void Start();
}

public class ACar {}
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/4507889577dd937dda844b8119782a50)
```java
public interface Engine
{
    void Start();
}

public class Vehicle {}
public class Car {}
```

# Detection

[X] Automatic  

If we have a Thesaurus we can point to awkward names.

# Exceptions

In C# it's a common practice to put "I" in the name of an interface because without it, you can't tell whether it is an interface or a class.

This is a language smell.

- Naming

# Conclusion

Use real names for your models.
