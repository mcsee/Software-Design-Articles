*Serious development is done by many different people. We have to start agreeing.*

> TL;DR: Don't mix different case conversions

# Problems

- Readability

- Maintainability

# Solutions

1. Choose a case standard

2. Hold on to it

# Context

When different people make software together they might have personal or cultural differences.

Some prefer [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)üê´, others [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)üêç, MACRO_CASEüó£Ô∏è, and [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Multiple-word_identifiers).

Code should be straightforward and readable.

# Sample Code

## Right

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/3dd8fd30a0c8c50538b401cbfb746ecc) -->

```json
{
    "id": 2,

  // This doesn't mean THIS standard is the right one
}
```

# Detection

[X] Automatic 

We can tell our linters about our company's broad [naming standards](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20exactly%20is%20a%20name%20-%20Part%20I%20The%20Quest/readme.md) and enforce them.

Whenever new people arrive at the organization, an automated test should politely ask him/her/.. to change the code.

# Exceptions

Whenever we need to interact with out of our scope code, we should use the client's standards, not ours.

# Tags

- Naming

# Conclusion

Dealing with standards is easy.

We need to enforce them.
