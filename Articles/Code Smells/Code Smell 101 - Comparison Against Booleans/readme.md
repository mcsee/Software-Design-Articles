# Code Smell 101 - Comparison Against Booleans

![Code Smell 101 - Comparison Against Booleans](Code%20Smell%20101%20-%20Comparison%20Against%20Booleans.jpg)

*When comparing to booleans, we perform magic castings and get unexpected results.*

> TL;DR: Don't compare against true. Either you are true, or false or you shouldn't compare

# Problems

- Hidden castings

- The least surprise principle violation.

- [Fail Fast](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Fail%20Fast/readme.md) principle violation

# Solutions

1. Use booleans

2. Don't mix booleans with *boolean castable objects*

# Context

Many languages cast values to boolean crossing domains.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/118ff2e5ebd9779675f664ed46bae95d)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ false ]; then
    echo "True"
else
    echo "False"
fi

# this evaluates to true since 
# "false" is a non-empty string

if [ false ] = true; then
    echo "True"
else
    echo "False"
fi

# this also evaluates to true
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/405d45ed06a94a81d1f1a3b06381c0f9)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if  false ; then
    echo "True"
else
    echo "False"
fi

# this evaluates to false
```

# Detection

[X] Automatic 

Linters can check for explicit comparisons and warnings.

# Tags

- Castings

# Conclusion

It is a common industry practice to use many non booleans as booleans. 

We should be very strict when using booleans.
