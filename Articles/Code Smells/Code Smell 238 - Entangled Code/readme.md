# Code Smell 238 - Entangled Code
            
![Code Smell 238 - Entangled Code](Code%20Smell%20238%20-%20Entangled%20Code.jpg)

*You execute code. Move to the other stuff, and continue with the previous code*

> TL;DR: Don't mix your train of thought

# Problems 😔 

- Readability

- Bad Scoping

# Solutions 😃

1. Move the code close together

2. Try to [extract the method](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Refactorings/Refactoring%20002%20-%20Extract%20Method/readme.md)

# Context 💬

Entangled code is related beyond time and space.

You are reading the code, then skip to another subject and return to the first one.

# Sample Code 📖

## Wrong 🚫

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/59914b6bd6ac72937d729894a52b5ec5) -->

```python
def planetary_properties(semi_major_axis,
                         incoming_radiation, reflected_radiation):
    Gravitational_Constant = 1.0    
    Sun_Mass = 1.0    
    # Up to here, there's a preparation
    # for the orbital period computation
    
    albedo = reflected_radiation / incoming_radiation
    # This is unrelated to the previous computation
    
    # You resume the first computation
    orbital_period_squared = (
        (4 * math.pi**2 * semi_major_axis**3) /
        (Gravitational_Constant * Sun_Mass)
    )
    retrun orbital_period, albedo
```

## Right 👉

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/4be2d21770d15e0b851a94fd5da0ec3f) -->

```python
def planetary_properties(semi_major_axis,
                         incoming_radiation, reflected_radiation):
    Gravitational_Constant = 1.0    
    Sun_Mass = 1.0    
     orbital_period_squared = (
        (4 * math.pi**2 * semi_major_axis**3) /
        (Gravitational_Constant * Sun_Mass)
    )
    # This is related to the first computation part
    
    albedo = reflected_radiation / incoming_radiation
    # This is related to the second part
    
    # The final solution is to break the function into two
    # This is a trivial example for illustration purposes
    # Things usually get more complicated and entangled
   
    retrun orbital_period, albedo
```
