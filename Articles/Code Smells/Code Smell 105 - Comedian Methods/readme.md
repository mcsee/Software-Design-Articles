# Detection

[X] Semi-Automatic 

We can have a list of forbidden words.

We can also check them in code reviews. 

Names are contextual, so it would be a difficult task for an automatic linter.

Naming conventions should be generic and should not include cultural jargon.

# Tags

- Naming

# Conclusion

Be professional in the way you name things in your code. 

Don't be try to be a comedian by giving a variable a silly name. 

You should write production code so future software developers (even you) should easily understand.
