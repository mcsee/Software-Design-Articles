# Code Smell 122 - Primitive Obsession

![Code Smell 122 - Primitive Obsession](Code%20Smell%20122%20-%20Primitive%20Obsession.jpg)

*Objects are there for the picking. Even the smallest ones.*

> TL;DR: Use small objects instead of primitive ones.

# Problems

- Code Duplication

- Small Objects Missing

- [Fail Fast](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Fail%20Fast/readme.md) principle violation.

- [Bijection Fault](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md)

- Subset violations: Emails are a subset of strings, Valid Ages are a subset of Real, Ports are a subset of Integers, etc.

- We spread Logic and Behavior in many places.

- Premature Optimization.

# Solutions

1. Create Small Objects

2. Build missing abstractions using [MAPPER](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md)

3. Use Value-Objects

# Context

We are very lazy to create small objects.

We are also lazy to separate *What* and *How*

We like very much to understand the *internals* of how things work.

We need to start thinking in a whitebox way and looking at the protocol and behavior of small components.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/12dc64f150fb047541b9aaa795d85faf)
```java
int port = 8080;
InetSocketAddress in = open("example.org", port);
String uri = urifromPort("example.org", port);
String address = addressFromPort("example.org", port);
String path = pathFromPort("example.org", port);
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/32202947a8d5ef760936a1e094d3f6b3)
```java
Port server = Port.parse(this, "www.example.org:8080");
// Port is a smallobject with responsibilities and protocol

Port in = server.open(this); // returns a port, not a number
URI uri = server.asUri(this); // returns an URI
InetSocketAddress address = server.asInetSocketAddress();
// returns an Address
Path path = server.path(this, "/index.html"); // returns a Path
// all of them are validated small bijection objects with very few and precise
// responsibilities
```

# Detection

[X] Manual

We can automate checks on constructors for small objects missing opportunities. 

# Tags

- Primitive Obsession

# Conclusion

We need to transform our strings, numbers, and arrays into small objects.

> Iteration allows us to progressively approach some goal. We can discard the steps that take us further away and prefer the steps that move us nearer. This is in essence how evolution works. It is also at the heart of how modern machine learning (ML) works.
