# Code Smell 217 - Empty Implementation
            
![Code Smell 217 - Empty Implementation](Code%20Smell%20217%20-%20Empty%20Implementation.jpg)

*You create empty methods instead of failing*

> TL;DR: Don't fill in methods to comply

# Problems

- Fail Fast Principle Violation

# Solutions

1.  Throw an error indicating implementation is not complete

# Context

Creating an empty implementation might seem fine to jump to more interesting problems. 

The code left won't fail fast so debugging it will be a bigger problem

# Sample Code

## Wrong

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/56e55a0fdee9d223fc050652b298f699) -->

```javascript
class MerchantProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    // no default implementation
  }
}

class MockMerchantProcessor extends MerchantProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
     // Empty implementation to comply with the compiler
     // Won't do anything
  }
}
```

## Right

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/77dcf4848f489f7011aefbe4971d4b0a) -->

```javascript
class MerchantProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    throw new Error('Should be overridden');
  }
}

class MockMerchantProcessor extends MerchantProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
     throw new Error('Will be implemented when needed');
  }
}

// or better...

class MockMerchantProcessor extends MerchantProcessor {
  processPayment(amount) {
    console.log('Mock payment processed: $${amount}');
  }
}
```

# Detection

[X] Manual

Since empty code is valid sometimes only a good peer review will find these problems.

# Tags

- Hierarchies

# Conclusion

Being lazy and deferring certain decisions is acceptable, but it's crucial to be explicit about it.
