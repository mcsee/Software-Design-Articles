![Code Smell 169 - Glued Methods](Code%20Smell%20169%20-%20Glued%20Methods.jpg)

*Don't make two or more things at once.*

> TL;DR: Try to be as atomic as possible in your methods

# Problems

- Coupled Code

- Harder to test

- Harder to read

# Solutions

1. Break the method

# Refactorings

[Refactoring 002 - Extract Method](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Refactorings/Refactoring%20002%20-%20Extract%20Method/readme.md)

# Context

If you name a method with 'And' you are probably missing an extract-and-break method opportunity.

# Sample Code

## Wrong

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/a5f7f776b32957ad3d40d57b4ff99c7f) -->

```rust
calculatePrimeFactorsRemoveDuplicatesAndPrintThem()

// Three responsibilities
```

## Right

<!-- [Gist Url](https://gist.github.com/mcsee/435d364b6ae0222952ace057ec099e94) -->

```rust
calculatePrimeFactors();

removeDuplicates();

printNumbers();

// Three different methods
// You can test them and reuse them
```

# Detection

[X] Semi-Automatic 

Some linters can warn us about methods including the term 'and'.

# Tags

- Coupling

# Conclusion

When making methods, it is very important to play some rubber duck story and tell ourselves if we are making things right.
