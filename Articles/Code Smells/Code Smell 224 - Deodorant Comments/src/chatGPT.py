def calculate_sum(number1, number2):
    # Calculate the sum of two numbers
    result = number1 + number2
    return result

# In this improved version:
#
# The function name calculate_sum is more descriptive than sum, 
# making it clear that this function calculates the sum of two numbers.
# (Wrong) it is more imperative and mistakes the 'what' with the 'how'
#
# The parameter names number1 and number2 are more meaningful 
# than adder and anotherAdder, helping to indicate the purpose of each parameter.
# (wrong) They indicate type instead of role
#
# The comment # Calculate the sum of two numbers provides a clear 
# and concise explanation of what the function does, 
# making it easier for someone reading the code to understand its purpose.    
# (wrong) in fact, it is an example of deodorant and useless comment
