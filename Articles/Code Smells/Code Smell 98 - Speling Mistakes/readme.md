*Spelling and readability are very important for humans and not important for machines.*

> TL;DR: Take care of your names.

# Problems

- Readability

- Harder to search terms in code.

# Solutions

1. Spellcheck your code.

2. Use an IDE with spellchecking

# Context

Many of us don't speak English as our first language. 

We need to have extra care for our texts and names.

*This article has a typo in its title as proof of context and also a clickbait*ðŸ˜€

# Conclusion

Pay close attention to your names. 

You will probably be the person reading the code in a few months.
