![Code Smell 98 - Speling Mistakes](Code%20Smell%2098%20-%20Speling%20Mistakes.jpeg)

*Spelling and readability are very important for humans and not important for machines.*

> TL;DR: Take care of your names.

# Problems

- Readability

- Harder to search terms in code.

# Solutions

1. Spellcheck your code.

2. Use an IDE with spellchecking

# Context

Many of us don't speak English as our first language. 

We need to have extra care for our texts and names.

*This article has a typo in its title as proof of context and also a clickbait*😀

# Sample Code

## Wrong

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/a4c5716a56fdb9b1b743debae3adfb4c)

```javascript
comboFeededBySupplyer = supplyer.providers();
```

## Right

[Gist Url]: # (https://gist.github.com/mcsee/1fc16a4982d8f423107d3e64d3c31e48)

```javascript
comboFedBySupplier = supplier.providers();
```

# Detection

[X] Manual
- We need to read the code in a peer review.

[X] Automatic
- Some IDEs have warnings on the typos.

# Tags

- Readability

- Naming

- Code Styling

# Conclusion

Pay close attention to your names. 

You will probably be the person reading the code in a few months.
