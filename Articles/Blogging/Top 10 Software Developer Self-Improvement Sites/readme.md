> TL;DR: What are the most helpful online tools to self-improve as a developer/software engineer

When it comes to finding an online community to help you improve as a software developer, there are many options available. 

Some are better than others when it comes to helping you learn new things.

Others are better for staying up-to-date on the latest trends and connecting with other like-minded individuals.

Many online communities support and encourage self-improvement for programmers. 

Some of these are more active and helpful than others.

If you're looking for a great online community to help you improve as a software developer, here are the best options:

# 1. Books

Books teach you theory and fundamentals. 

You can learn tips and tricks, hacks, and quick solutions for problems online.

You can do magic as an empowered junior developer and build fancy software.

But you need to learn [boring fundamentals](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Opinion/Software%20Engineer%20Maxi%20Contieri%20on%20writing%20about%20boring%20fundamentals/readme.md) and [theory](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Programming%20as%20Theory%20Building/readme.md) to improve your career.

If you ever want to move to the major leagues you need to read books. Period.

I like the [O'Reilly Platform](https://learning.oreilly.com/) since it provides you with all the books you will never need and also has amazing streaming content.

It is an amazing continuous learning platform.

# 2. LinkedIn Learning

[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) is an online education platform that offers courses on a wide variety of topics.

It is also a great resource for anyone looking to learn new skills or improve their resume.

The platform offers a wide variety of courses, from technical and software related to soft skill development.

I add value to my technical background with many courses related to negotiation, management, life hacks, presentations, productivity, teamwork etc.

I try to make 2 or 3 courses per week.

There are amazing other learning places like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and so on.

# 3. Twitter

Twitter is a social media platform that's popular with software developers.

It's a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest news.

You can also find out about new tools and frameworks, and connect with [amazing developers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1312444036540772359).

I curated my timeline [following developers](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Twitter/The%20Tech%20Twitter%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy/readme.md) and book writers.

I get to talk with amazing people, book outers, and people who built the foundations of our profession.

I unfollow people who talk about politics, fashion, sports, arts, etc.

I follow them on other social networks.

# 4. Tech Blogs

I write, read and moderate a lot of programming blogs.

I read about 50 technical articles a day and save them on [Pocket](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Productivity/16%20Simple%20Tips%20to%20Boost%20Your%20Productivity%20x10/readme.md) and InoReader for the weekends.

If you follow relevant tags, you will find amazing content daily.

# 5. Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is one of the most popular online communities for software developers. 

It's a Q&A platform where developers can ask and answer questions on a variety of topics. 

Stack Overflow is also a great resource for finding code snippets and solutions to common programming problems.

It is a question-and-answer site and also has many other features such as a blog, a jobs board, and a wiki. 

Stack Overflow is a great place to go for help with specific coding problems.

I use them for very small problems since most of the answers have premature optimization solutions.

I used to answer questions there but the haters are strong, and it is not a safe place for debate.

# 6. GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is primarily a code hosting and collaboration platform, but it also has a very active community. 

It's also a great place to find open source projects to contribute to and connect with other developers.

GitHub allows you to read a lot of code and learn from it.

Since it is not curated, it might be difficult for a junior to distinguish a good solution from a bad one.

# 7. Reddit

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a vast online community with millions of users. 

There's a subreddit for almost everything, including a large number of programming-related subreddits. 

Reddit is a great place to find news, information, and discussion on a variety of topics.

These can be a great place to get help with specific problems, or to chat with other programmers about various topics.

There are also many language-specific online communities. 

These can be a great place to learn more about a particular language or to find help with specific problems. 

It has the same problem as stack overflow: is a hard place to contribute since it is not very safe for newcomers.

# 8. Quora

[Quora](https://www.quora.com/) is a Q&A platform like Stack Overflow. 

Quora is focused on more general questions and topics. 

It's a great place to ask questions and get answers from experts on a variety of topics, including programming.

Questions are short and open.

I usually ask about astrophysics and cosmology and sometimes answer about software development.

# 9. Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a communication platform that allows people to connect.

It is organized around servers, which are further organized into channels. 

There are a lot of developer-related channels.

Discord is an amazing place to practice pair programming.

Discord offers both text and voice chat, and each channel can be configured to use one or both.

# 10. Niche Communities

Many online communities can be helpful for self-improvement as a programmer. 

These include local meetups, [conferences](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/TDD%20Conference%202021/TDD%20Conference%202021%20-%20All%20Talks/readme.md), and hackathons. 

Attending these events can be a great way to meet other programmers.

You can also learn new skills and stay up-to-date on the latest trends in programming.

Find your niche, and find your support community.
