> TL;DR: The reasons I write Technical Content articles

# When?

I have always been passionate about education and helping others learn. 

I am also a creative and pedagogic person.

I have been teaching programming at the University for 20 years.

As a software engineer, I have 25 years of experience and knowledge in the field to share with others. 

When I discovered the world of content creation and technical writing, I knew I had to get involved in.

There are real [threats](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/GPT-3%20Training%20Programmers%20for%20the%20Present%20(and%20the%20Future)/readme.md) for developers on the horizon.

# Why?

As a developer and teacher, I often find myself creating content for a variety of reasons. 

Creating content is a great way to share my knowledge and help people learn about software development.

It also helps me communicate my ideas and share my knowledge with others, keeps my skills up-to-date, and improves my problem-solving abilities.

It can also be a form of stress relief and can help me stay [organized and focused](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Productivity/What%20is%20JOMO%20and%20Why%20it%20will%20Increase%20your%20Productivity%20x97/readme.md).

One of the main reasons is that it helps me learn more about development out of my comfort zone. 

I'm forced to think about *what* I'm doing and *why* it works. 

This process of learning helps me become a better and more complete developer.

# Whom?

Creating content allows me to express myself and connect with others who have similar interests. 

I know that there are a lot of people out there desiring to learn to code.

Many of them don't know where to start. 

By creating content for [beginners](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md), I can help them take their first steps toward becoming a developer.

I love coming up with new ideas for articles, videos, and courses, and seeing the positive impact of my work.

I also enjoy the challenge of taking complex topics and explaining them in a way that is easy to understand. 

It's also satisfying to see my work help others learn more about development and even start their own journey.

Writing technical articles is a great way to connect with other educators and learn from them. 

I am always learning new things myself, and I love being able to share what I have learned with others.

# Who?

As a developer, you're always learning new things. 

A new language, framework, or tool, there's always something to keep you busy. 

You seldom have time for learning [software fundamentals](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md).

But what happens when you need to teach someone else? 

Whether you're a senior developer leading a team or a newbie teaching yourself, you need to know how to teach other developers. 

# What?

I mostly write about programming fundamentals, code smells, refactorings and TDD.

I think learning fancy frameworks and tools is not the best path for a beginner.

You will get biased towards an [accidental](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/No%20Silver%20Bullet/readme.md) decision instead of learning [essential contents](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/Null%20-%20The%20Billion%20Dollar%20Mistake/readme.md).

# How?

Here are a few personal tips: 

1 Find your audience level

Before you start teaching, you need to find out what your student already knows. This way, you can tailor your teaching to their needs and avoid repeating things they already know. 

2 Start with the basics

Once you know what your student knows, you can start with the basics. If they're new to the topic, start from scratch. If they already know something, you might need to check it the [fundamentals](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) are good

3 Use very simple language

When you're teaching, use simple language that your student can understand. Avoid technical jargon and acronyms, and explain things in a way that anyone can understand.

4 Use code examples

Examples are a great way to illustrate a concept. If you can, find or create examples that your student can follow along with. This will help them understand the concept and see how it's used in practice. Do not write all the examples using the same language.

5 Practice, practice, practice

Practice makes perfect. After you've gone over a concept, you need to practice it. This could be through exercises, challenges, or real-world projects. The more they practice, the better they'll understand and be able to apply the concept.

6 Be patient

Learning can be tough, so it's important to be patient with your students. They might not understand everything right away, and that's okay. Keep working with them and supporting them, and they'll get there.

7 Be Consistent

Use a writing method and standard tools.

# Where?

Teaching other developers can be challenging, but it's also rewarding. By following these tips, you can set your students up for success and help them learn.

Creating content is an excellent way for me to share my knowledge, stay sharp, and connect with others. Itâ€™s a win-win for everyone involved.

For learning purposes, to help others, or for fun, creating content is a great way to share my knowledge and help people learn more about the wonderful world of development.
