# Today I Learned the Concept of Gardening

*Why taking care of our past work is also very important.*

# The new concept

At [Hashnode Bootcamp](https://hashnode.com/bootcamp/batch-3) I heard the word *Gardening* for the first time at @samjulien's talk.

I rushed to Wikipedia to see if the metaphor was specialized to other domains.

%[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening]

To my astonishment, Wikipedia is not aware of the term (beyond its obvious meaning).

I usually revisit my own articles since they are related among each other but I don't do major changes on them.üìï

This is a pity since I write about [programming core concepts](https://hashnode.com/n/programming/recent), and they are [less volatile than fancy new technology tutorials](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Blogging/The%20Complete%20Etiquette%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20programming%20Articles%20on%20Hashnode/readme.md). üò•

I usually write the articles, polish them, publish on social media and forget about them in a few days.

# Missed Opportunities

Writing technical articles takes a [lot of time and effort](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Blogging/The%20Complete%20Etiquette%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20programming%20Articles%20on%20Hashnode/readme.md), and the *publishing window* is very narrow, so there's always a chance most of our audience will miss them. üòß

Unless we have [great SEO](https://catalins.tech/canonical-url-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-care) mastering, there's not much of a chance someone will read the article after publishing date.

Even for our new followers! üòõ

I wrote more than [100 articles](https://maximilianocontieri/) on @hashnode and my new followers may not be aware of them.

# The Strategy

From now on, I will revisit my old articles, gather the comments and suggestions and all feedback to refurbish them.

I am more aware today of [great tools](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Blogging/10%20Invaluable%20Tips%20for%20Successful%20Tech%20Articles/readme.md) and I can improve past articles with these new tools.

Hashnode adds page metadata if we update our articles:


```
<meta itemProp="dateModified" content="2020-12-22T13:43:58.780Z"/>
``` 
 
I will also add a footer showing when was the article last visited. This is not for search engines but for us, humans to show how we care for our shinny garden.
