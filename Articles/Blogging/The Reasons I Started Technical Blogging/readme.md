*Senior Developers have learning reasons too.*

> TL;DR: My personal reasons to start writting

Hello Everyone! 

Recently I attended Hashnode Bootcamp III, and also had some interviews on a couple of podcasts.

One of the podcast's hosts: @[Sonny Alves Dias](@sonny-ad) asked me the reasons why I decided to blog. 

Here I go.

# 1 - I Want to share my 25 years of experience as a software developer and teacher.üë¥üèæ

I've worked in many industries, small and large companies. I worked as a software engineer, QA engineer, auditor, manager, CTO, etc.

I worked in private-owned companies and also built some startups from scratch.

I've been teaching at the university since I graduated in computer science.

I've seen tons of code reviews and I came across some software design solutions.

# 2 - I need to learn new things not to become obsolete.üè´

Many of my old university mates decided to stick to some tech stack and this is fine. 
I still get excited when I hear something new about technology (lastly React and [GPT3](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Artificial%20Intelligence/I've%20Recently%20Learned%20About%20GPT3%20-%20This%20is%20my%20Journey/readme.md)).

I have a different attitude.

I try to learn new concepts and technologies and also value old but very actual software engineering theories.

# 3 - If You Really Want to Master Something, Teach It.üë®‚Äçüè´

The person who learns the most in any classroom is the teacher.
I started to write a code smell series and I had 10 or 15 articles on the back of my mind.

To my surprise, lots of people suggested new smells.

I also took several courses on clean code, read some classic books again, and did research both on academia and also online.

Up to now, I wrote 67 smells and still have a lot of drafts to polish and publish.

# 4 - The Lock-Down.üò∑

"Crisis" also means opportunity.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, I discovered I had plenty of spare time. Being an outdoor guy I realize I could watch Netflix or write articles.

This was very true on lockdown weekends.

My approach was to connect with people from every corner of the world and exchange software experiences.

# 5 I want to diversify my revenue stream.üí∏

Old senior developers also become obsolete and less sexy for the market.

I currently have a full-time job and I also get paid at the university. 

Looking for an extra income is not a sin at all.
