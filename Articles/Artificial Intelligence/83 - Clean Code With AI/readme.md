> TL;DR: This is my talk at Tech Excellence on combining Artificial Intelligence and Clean Code

# Summary

How can you leverage ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and other assistants to write clean code? What instructions should you provide them? How do you configure them to assist you?

Code assistants were trained on datasets that were not so well curated. You often ask them for solutions that meet requirements but do not reflect good designs. However, with some instructions, you can indicate how we want them to assist you. This way, their solutions will comply with good development practices and be customized according to your rules.

You will see concrete examples and tips to make the most of these magnificent tools by combining your creativity with all available knowledge. After watching the talk, you can explain your rules for immediate assistance in your studies, work, and more. This will enhance your professional career, preparing you for the future demands of the job market.
