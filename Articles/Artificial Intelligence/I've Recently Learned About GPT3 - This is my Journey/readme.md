*My future project on text transformers applied to code.*

I've been very excited since GPT-3 release almost a year ago.

I applied early for closed beta, but had no news so far.

The product is nowadays controlled by Microsoft, and they are gatekeeping it to avoid unethical uses (and avoid [past mistakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)).

I've read some very interesting articles related to GPT-3:

%[https://hashnode.com/search?q=gpt-3]

https://anujsyal.com/gpt-3-the-latest-language-model-in-ai-c8634a314911

... and made some theoretical courses on it

By now, GPT-3 is closer to [narrow artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI) than [Artificial General intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). But it is a very successful narrow transformer deceiving humans for long time periods.

# State of the art

There are not many GPT-3 Implementations due to being on closed beta. 

There's an incipient app marketplace

https://gpt3demo.com/

Hopefully it will grow soon.

# Moving forward

I've been thinking a lot about transformers and generators applied to programming.

Most code generators I've tested are too dumb. They can program very basic routines and are not yet able to create [great software designs](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md).

In my Code Smell Series, I suggest detection techniques and correction measures. 

[How to Find the Stinky parts of your Code](https://github.com/mcsee/Software-Design-Articles/tree/main/Articles/Code%20Smells/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Stinky%20parts%20of%20your%20Code/readme.md)

Some of them involve just syntactic manipulations most actual linters can do.

But, many of them require pattern recognition and some added intelligence. 

**I am anxious to build a GPT3 solution to assist programmers and made code reviews.**

What do you think? Will we be using them in the near future?
