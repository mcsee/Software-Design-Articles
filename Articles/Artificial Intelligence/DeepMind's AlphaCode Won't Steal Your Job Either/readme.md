# DeepMind's AlphaCode Won't Steal Your Job Either

*Another new fancy AI tool. We keep getting closer to the singularity. But not on programming.*

> TL;DR: Wait until machine learning solutions solve real business problems.

[Alphabet's DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/about), [Microsoft's Github](https://copilot.github.com/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) are leading the Artificial Intelligence coding segment.

With different approaches, they try to solve coding challenges.

They use [transformer-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model) language models to generate code.

> AlphaCode [achieved](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode) an estimated rank within the top 54% of participants in programming competitions by solving new problems that require a combination of critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding, and natural language understanding.

Deep Mind's product was trained and competed against humans at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) contests.

With overfitting claims, it outperformed several people at those contests.

[Results](https://github.com/deepmind/code_contests) are available online.

A careful look at the datasets shows basic algorithmic solutions with output code full of [code smells](../../Code%20Smells/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Stinky%20parts%20of%20your%20Code/readme.md) many human counterparts make.

Variables with [bad names](../../Theory/What%20exactly%20is%20a%20name%20â€”%20Part%20II%20Rehab/readme.md), [Lots of ifs](../../Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2036%20-%20Switch%20case%20elseif%20else%20if%20statements/readme.md), [too long methods](../../Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2003%20-%20Functions%20Are%20Too%20Long/readme.md), [global functions](../../Code%20Smells/Code%20Smell%2017%20-%20Global%20Functions/readme.md) are some examples of these smells many code reviewers would not approve.

The three current solutions (AlphaCode, [GitHub Copilot](../../Artificial%20Intelligence/Why%20GitHub%20Copilot%20is%20not%20a%20Threat%20to%20your%20Job/readme.md), [GPT3](../../Artificial%20Intelligence/I've%20Recently%20Learned%20About%20GPT3%20-%20This%20is%20my%20Journey/readme.md)) focus on competitive programming, an area where performance is the ultimate goal and readability is not important. 

# The final frontier

Model [domain entities](../../Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md) and business behavior instead of boring and repetitive algorithms full of code smells.

Try to understand the entities and the behaviour on your simulation software.
