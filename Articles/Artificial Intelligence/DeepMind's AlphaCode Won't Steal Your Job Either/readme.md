# DeepMind's AlphaCode Won't Steal Your Job Either

*Another new fancy AI tool. We keep getting closer to the singularity. But not on programming.*

> TL;DR: Wait until machine learning solutions solve real business problems.

[Alphabet's DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/about), [Microsoft's Github](https://copilot.github.com/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) are leading the Artificial Intelligence coding segment.

With different approaches, they try to solve coding challenges.

They use [transformer-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model) language models to generate code.

> AlphaCode [achieved](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode) an estimated rank within the top 54% of participants in programming competitions by solving new problems that require a combination of critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding, and natural language understanding.

Deep Mind's product was trained and competed against humans at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) contests.

With overfitting claims, it outperformed several people at those contests.

[Results](https://github.com/deepmind/code_contests) are available online.

A careful look at the datasets shows basic algorithmic solutions with output code full of [code smells]() many human counterparts make.

Variables with [bad names](Theory\What exactly is a name â€” Part II Rehab), [Lots of ifs](Code Smells\Code Smell 36 - Switch case elseif else if statements), [too long methods](Code Smells\Code Smell 03 - Functions Are Too Long), [global functions](Code Smells\Code Smell 17 - Global Functions) are some examples of these smells many code reviewers would not approve.

The three current solutions (AlphaCode, [GitHub Copilot](Artificial Intelligence\Why GitHub Copilot is not a Threat to your Job), [GPT3](Artificial Intelligence\I've Recently Learned About GPT3 - This is my Journey)) focus on competitive programming, an area where performance is the ultimate goal and readability is not important. 

# The final frontier

Model [domain entities](Theory\The One and Only Software Design Principle) and business behavior instead of boring and repetitive algorithms full of code smells.

Try to understand the entities and the behaviour on your simulation software.

# What should you do?

Stop competing against smarter machines than you.

[Learn](Theory\What is (wrong with) software) and [model](Theory\The One and Only Software Design Principle) rich domains.

You will [keep your job](Opinion\(Most) Programmers are losing our jobs very soon) for a few more years...
