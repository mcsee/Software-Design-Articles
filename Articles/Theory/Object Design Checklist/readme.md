## This is an index to already published articles on software design.

_There are some rules to follow and embrace to make great software designs. This article will summarize them, serving as an index to full stories._

# Axioms

Build a _MAPPER_

[What is (wrong with) software?](../../Theory/What%20is%20(wrong%20with)%20software/readme.md)

Keep a **bijection** to real entities:

[The One and Only Software Design Principle](../../Theory/The%20One%20and%20Only%20Software%20Design%20Principle/readme.md)

# Corollaries

Do not use **null**

[Null: The Billion Dollar Mistake](../../Theory/Null%20-%20The%20Billion%20Dollar%20Mistake/readme.md)

Avoid **Accidental IFs**

[How to Get Rid of Annoying IFs Forever](../../Theory/How%20to%20Get%20Rid%20of%20Annoying%20IFs%20Forever/readme.md)

Favor **immutability**:

[The Evil Power of Mutants](../../Theory/The%20Evil%20Power%20of%20Mutants/readme.md)

Avoid **Setters** and **Getters**:

[Nude Models - Part I: Setters](../../Theory/Nude%20Models - Part%20I Setters/readme.md)

[Nude Models - Part II: Getters](../../Theory/Nude%20Models - Part%20II Getters/readme.md)

## Best practices

Avoid **Coupling**:

[Coupling - The one and only software design problem](../../Theory/Coupling%20-%20The%20one%20and%20only%20software%20design%20problem/readme.md)

Fail **Fast**:

[Fail Fast](../../Theory/Fail%20Fast/readme.md)

Avoid **Meta-Programming**:

[Laziness I - Metaprogramming](../../Theory/Laziness%20I%20-%20Metaprogramming/readme.md)

Avoid **Dynamic Code Generation**:

[Laziness II - Code Wizards](../../Theory/Laziness%20II%20-%20Code%20Wizards/readme.md)

Choose **meaningful names**

[What exactly is a name — Part I The Quest](../../Theory/What%20exactly%20is%20a%20name%20—%20Part%20I%20The%20Quest/readme.md)

[What exactly is a name — Part II Rehab](../../Theory/What%20exactly%20is%20a%20name%20—%20Part%20II%20Rehab/readme.md)

Build a **Theory**

[Programming as Theory Building](../../Theory/Programming%20as%20Theory%20Building/readme.md)

Avoid **Accidental** Complexity

[No Silver Bullet](../../Theory/No%20Silver%20Bullet/readme.md)

Get **Inspired** by Quotes

[Software Engineering Great Quotes](../../Quotes/Software%20Engineering%20Great%20Quotes/readme.md)

## Anti Patterns

Do not use **Singleton**:

[Singleton - The root of all evil](../../Theory/Singleton%20-%20The%20root%20of%20all%20evil/readme.md)

Avoid Code Smells

[How to Find the Stinky parts of your Code](../../Code%20Smells/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Stinky%20parts%20of%20your%20Code/readme.md)

## Exercises

[How to Decouple a Legacy System](../../Theory/How%20to%20Decouple%20a%20Legacy%20System/readme.md)

[How to Squeeze Test Driven Development on Legacy Systems](../../TDD/How%20to%20Squeeze%20Test%20Driven%20Development%20on%20Legacy%20Systems/readme.md)

[How I Survived the Zombie Apocalypse](../../TDD/How%20I%20Survived%20the%20Zombie%20Apocalypse/readme.md)
